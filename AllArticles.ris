N2  - BACKGROUND: Residency program leaders are required to support resident well-being, but often they do not receive training in how to do so., OBJECTIVE: To determine frequency in which program leadership provides support for resident well-being, comfort in supporting resident well-being, and factors associated with need for additional training in supporting resident well-being., METHODS: National cross-sectional web-based survey in June 2015 of pediatric program directors, associate program directors, and coordinators about their experiences supporting resident well-being. Univariate and bivariate descriptive statistics compared responses between groups. Generalized linear modeling, adjusting for program region, size, program leadership role, and number of years in role determined factors associated with need for additional training., RESULTS: The response rate was 39.3% (322/820). Most respondents strongly agreed that supporting resident well-being is an important part of their role, but few reported supporting resident well-being as part of their job description. Most reported supporting residents' clinical, personal, and health issues at least annually, and in some cases weekly, with 72% spending >10%of their time on resident well-being. Most program leaders desired more training. After adjusting for level of comfort in dealing with resident well-being issues, program leaders more frequently exposed to resident well-being issues were more likely to desire additional training (P<.02)., CONCLUSIONS: Program leaders spend a significant amount of time supporting resident well-being. Although they think that supporting resident well-being is an important part of their job, opportunities exist for developing program leaders through including resident wellness on job descriptions and training program leaders how to support resident well-being.Copyright © 2018 Academic Pediatric Association.

N2  - AIMS: To evaluate the effectiveness of the Kansas Nurse Leader Residency (KNLR) programme in improving nurses' leadership knowledge and skills and its acceptability, feasibility and fidelity., BACKGROUND: The Future of Nursing Report (Institute of Medicine, 2011) calls for nurses to lead change and advance health. The 6-month KNLR programme was developed by the Kansas Action Coalition to support nurses' leadership development., METHODS: Nurses (n = 36) from four nursing specialties (acute care, long-term care, public health and school health) participated in the programme. The adapted Leader Knowledge and Skill Inventory was used to assess leadership knowledge and skills. Programme acceptability, feasibility and implementation fidelity also were evaluated., RESULTS: The programme completion rate was 67.7% (n = 24). Programme completers had significantly improved self-assessed and mentor-assessed leadership knowledge and skills (p < .05). These post-programme gains were maintained 3 months after programme completion., CONCLUSIONS: The KNLR programme effectively improved leadership knowledge and skills and was positively evaluated by participants. The implementation of the KNLR programme using a hybrid format of in-person sessions and online modules was feasible across four specialty areas in both rural and urban regions., IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: The next steps include the development of an advanced programme. Residency programmes for new nurse leaders are critical for successful transition into management positions.Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Y1  - 2018//
N2  - Purpose Physician leadership programs serve to develop individual capabilities and to affect organizational outcomes. Evaluations of such programs often focus solely on short-term increases in individual capabilities. The purpose of this paper is to assess long-term individual and organizational outcomes of the Stanford Leadership Development Program. Design/methodology/approach There are three data sources for this mixed-methods study: a follow-up survey in 2013-2014 of program participants ( n=131) and matched (control) non-participants ( n=82) from the 2006 to 2011 program years; promotion and retention data; and qualitative in-person interview data. The authors analyzed survey data across leadership knowledge, skills, and attitudes as well as leadership titles held, following program participation using Pearson's chi2 test of independence. Using logistic regression, the authors analyzed promotion and retention among participants and non-participants. Finally, the authors applied both a grounded theory approach and qualitative content analysis to analyze interview data. Findings Program participants rated higher than non-participants across 25 of 30 items measuring leadership knowledge, skills, and attitudes, and were more likely to hold regional/national leadership titles and to have gained in leadership since program participation. Asian program participants were significantly more likely than Asian non-participants to have been promoted, and women participants were less likely to have left the institution than non-participants. Finally, qualitative interviews revealed the long-term impact of leadership learning and networking, as well as the enduring, sustained impact on the organization of projects undertaken during the program. Originality/value This study is unique in its long-term and comprehensive mixed-methods nature of evaluation to assess individual and organizational impact of a physician leadership program.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Transitioning to competency-based surgical training will require consensus regarding the scope of plastic surgery and expectations of operative ability for graduating residents. Identifying surgical procedures experts deemed most important in preparing graduates for independent practice (i.e., "core" procedures), and those that are less important or deemed more appropriate for fellowship training (i.e., "noncore" procedures), will focus instructional and assessment efforts., METHODS: Canadian plastic surgery program directors, the Canadian Society of Plastic Surgeons Executive Committee, and peer-nominated experts participated in an online, multiround, modified Delphi consensus exercise. Over three rounds, panelists were asked to sort 288 procedural competencies into five predetermined categories within core and noncore procedures, reflecting increasing expectations of ability. Eighty percent agreement was chosen to indicate consensus., RESULTS: Two hundred eighty-eight procedures spanning 13 domains were identified. Invitations were sent to 49 experts; 37 responded (75.5 percent), and 31 participated (83.8 percent of respondents). Procedures reaching 80 percent consensus increased from 101 (35 percent) during round 1, to 159 (55 percent) in round 2, and to 199 (69 percent) in round 3. The domain "burns" had the highest rate of agreement, whereas "lower extremity" had the lowest agreement. Final consensus categories included 154 core, essential; 23 core, nonessential; three noncore, experience; and 19 noncore, fellowship., CONCLUSIONS: This study provides clarity regarding which procedures plastic surgery experts deem most important for preparing graduates for independent practice. The list represents a snapshot of expert opinion regarding the current training environment. As our specialty grows and changes, this information will need to be periodically revisited.

N2  - PROBLEM: While leadership development is increasingly a goal of academic medicine, it is typically framed as competency acquisition, which can limit its focus to a circumscribed set of social behaviors. This orientation may also reinforce the cultural characteristics of academic medicine that can make effective leadership difficult, rather than training leaders capable of examining and changing this culture. Expanding leadership development so it promotes social reflexivity presents a way to bolster some of the weaknesses of the competency paradigm., APPROACH: In 2013-2016, the University of Penn sylvania's Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care (DACC) carried out a leadership development program for residents, which included seminars focused on developing particular leadership skills and annual capstone sessions facilitating discussion between residents and attending physicians about topics chosen by residents. The capstone sessions proved to be most impactful, serving as forums for open conversation about how these groups interact when engaged in social behaviors such as giving/receiving feedback, offering support after an adverse event, and teaching/learning in the clinic., OUTCOMES: The success of the capstone sessions led to a 2016 DACC-wide initiative to facilitate transparency among all professional roles (faculty, residents, nurse anesthetists, administrative staff) and encourage widespread reflexive examination about how the manner in which these groups interact encourages or impedes leadership and teamwork., NEXT STEPS: Further work is necessary to describe how leadership program formats can be diversified to better encourage reflexivity. There is also a need to develop mechanisms for assessing outcomes of leadership programs that expand outside the competency-based system.

N2  - The purpose of this article is to describe the business case framework used to guide doctor of nursing practice (DNP) program enhancements and to discuss methods used to gain chief nurse executives' (CNEs) perspectives for desired curricular and experiential content for doctor of nursing practice nurses in health care system executive roles. Principal results of CNE interview responses were closely aligned to the knowledge, skills and/or attitudes identified by the national leadership organizations. Major conclusions of this article are that curriculum change should include increased emphasis on leadership, implementation science, and translation of evidence into practice methods. Business, information and technology management, policy, and health care law content would also need to be re-balanced to facilitate DNP graduates' health care system level practice.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Because of modern challenges in quality, safety, patient centeredness, and cost, health care is evolving to adopt leadership practices of highly effective organizations. Traditional physician training includes little focus on developing leadership skills, which necessitates further training to achieve the potential of collaborative management., PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to design a leadership program using established models for continuing medical education and to assess its impact on participants' knowledge, skills, attitudes, and performance., METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: The program, delivered over 9 months, addressed leadership topics and was designed around a framework based on how physicians learn new clinical skills, using multiple experiential learning methods, including a leadership active learning project. The program was evaluated using Kirkpatrick's assessment levels: reaction to the program, learning, changes in behavior, and results. Four cohorts are evaluated (2008-2011)., RESULTS: Reaction: The program was rated highly by participants (mean = 4.5 of 5). Learning: Significant improvements were reported in knowledge, skills, and attitudes surrounding leadership competencies. Behavior: The majority (80%-100%) of participants reported plans to use learned leadership skills in their work. Improved team leadership behaviors were shown by increased engagement of project team members., RESULTS: All participants completed a team project during the program, adding value to the institution., CONCLUSION: Results support the hypothesis that learning approaches known to be effective for other types of physician education are successful when applied to leadership development training. Across all four assessment levels, the program was effective in improving leadership competencies essential to meeting the complex needs of the changing health care system., PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Developing in-house programs that fit the framework established for continuing medical education can increase physician leadership competencies and add value to health care institutions. Active learning projects provide opportunities to practice leadership skills addressing real word problems.

Y1  - 2017//
N2  - Objective: This pilot project, which was jointly conducted by a hospital and a university, describes the development of the Master's Degree Programme in Leadership in Medicine, a course designed to supplement medical specialty training. The aim of the pilot project is to demonstrate how hospital-based projects on personnel and organisational development undertaken under academic supervision can be used to increase leadership responsibility among doctors whose duties include providing initial and follow-on training and to professionalise medical specialty training as a leadership task. This need arose from the nationwide requirements and an internal audit regarding follow-on training. The version of the degree programme described below aims to further the personnel development of the participants in the field of didactics. Method: Each of the nine modules is made up of two classroom-based phases and one distance learning phase. The distance learning phase involves undertaking hospital-based projects on personnel and organisational development under academic supervision. The pilot phase participants were hospital doctors who, as part of their duties, hold leadership responsibility or are involved in the follow-on training of doctors. Results: The 17 participants successfully implemented more than 30 hospital-based projects during the distance learning phases of the nine modules. These projects included the development of medical specialty curricula, relevant didactic methods and evaluation design and were subsequently presented and subjected to reflection in interdisciplinary groups. The project presentation together with the project report were regarded as proof of competency. Conclusion: In addition to enhancing participant competency, the degree model described, which interlinks theory and practice, promotes organisational development through the implementation of projects undertaken under academic supervision. This has a double impact on the quality of medical follow-on training at the hospital where the participant is based, for not only is the individual's didactic competency enhanced, but so is the "learning organisation" as a whole as a result of continuous project orientation.

N2  - PURPOSE: The development and implementation of a certificate program for pharmacy residents are described., SUMMARY: University of North Carolina (UNC) Medical Center met the call for increased efforts in the area of pharmacy residency leadership training through the design, implementation, and evaluation of a leadership certificate program. The purpose of the UNC certificate program is to develop leaders who will serve others, improve their communities, and advance the profession. The program is designed to (1) foster self-awareness, social awareness, and altruism, (2) provide transferable and individualized leadership experiences, (3) enrich other residency components through integration of leadership development opportunities, and (4) create role models for departmental leadership. A team of preceptors and residents implemented the certificate program by integrating program components into the existing pharmacy residency infrastructure. The certificate program includes required and flexible components to allow residents to set and achieve their determined leadership development goals. Overall, residents are satisfied with the program and perceive it as worthwhile. During the first 3 years since implementation of the certification initiative, program facilitators improved the feasibility of, participant engagement in, and sustainability of the program. Future directions include an effectiveness evaluation and a "scale-up" to other institutions., CONCLUSION: The need for a pharmacy residency leadership certificate was met by designing, implementing, and evaluating such a program at UNC. Through its first 3 years, the program was feasible, sustainable, and valued by program participants.Copyright © 2017 by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: The ongoing changes in health care delivery have resulted in the reform of educational content and methods of training in postgraduate medical leadership education. Health care law and medical errors are domains in medical leadership where medical residents desire training. However, the potential value of the flipped classroom as a pedagogical tool for leadership training within postgraduate medical education has not been fully explored. Therefore, we designed a learning module for this purpose and made use of the flipped classroom model to deliver the training., EVIDENCE: The flipped classroom model reverses the order of learning: basic concepts are learned individually outside of class so that more time is spent applying knowledge to discussions and practical scenarios during class. Advantages include high levels of interaction, optimal utilization of student and expert time and direct application to the practice setting. Disadvantages include the need for high levels of self-motivation and time constraints within the clinical setting., DISCUSSION: Educational needs and expectations vary within various generations and call for novel teaching modalities. Hence, the choice of instructional methods should be driven not only by their intrinsic values but also by their alignment with the learners' preference. The flipped classroom model is an educational modality that resonates with Millennial students. It helps them to progress quickly beyond the mere understanding of theory to higher order cognitive skills such as evaluation and application of knowledge in practice. Hence, the successful application of this model would allow the translation of highly theoretical topics to the practice setting within postgraduate medical education.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the benefit of Leadership and Management Courses for clinicians, specifically which leadership and management contents are beneficial to their daily clinical work and whether these contents support their individual career., METHOD: E-mail invitations to participate in the study were sent to all 543 medical doctors of the University Hospital Hanover, Germany, who had taken part in one of the leadership and management courses offered between June 2005 and June 2015. The enquiry was carried out between June 1 and June 30, 2015. 84 e-mail addresses were no longer active; and so, N=459 clinicians actually received the invitation. Of these, 104 participated (22.7%)., RESULTS: The study included 59 items. Six were free text items, twelve items were closed questions which could be answered by choosing from a drop down menu, and 41 were answered on a Likert scale from 0 (not fitting at all) to 10 (perfect fit). Based on the items answered on a Likert scale, the following scales and mean values were deduced: Job Satisfaction (M=7.44); Leadership (M=7.77); Trust (M=7.22); Striving for Power (M=7,45); negative Affect (M=4,91); Target Achievement Motivation (M=8.19); Communication (M=8.30) and Management (M=6.48). Regression analysis showed that Job- and Team Satisfaction can predict to what extent the participants regard themselves as good leaders. The study participants defined the following topics as very important: leadership and management style, managerial functions, team management, human resources development and project management. Further topics included rhetoric skills, presentation techniques, as well as basic economics such as understanding balance sheets, profit & loss statements and contribution margin calculation. 55% of the course contents were described as being directly applicable to their daily working environment. In the clinicians' view, the ideal leader acts as a role model (passing on values like respect, appreciation, honesty, openness, fairness, sense of justice, and empathy), someone who motivates his colleagues by giving them a vision, structure and transparency. The participants estimated that they met 60% of these qualifications. 51% of the participants found the course highly beneficial, and 45% rated it as being beneficial. 55% said that the course boosted their career. 96% were willing to attend further leadership and management courses. 98% would recommend the course to their colleagues., CONCLUSION: The return rate of 22.7%, the subjective benefit of the courses (96%), the willingness to attend such courses (96%) and to recommend them to colleagues (98%) demonstrates that clinicians are highly interested in leadership and management topics. This may be due to the fact that these topics are not part of the training program for medical students or junior doctors. Our findings are in consistent with organisational and psychological research results showing that "soft" psychological factors related to leadership topics are a significant and crucial factor behind the success of organisations and hospitals.Copyright © 2017.

N2  - PURPOSE: The purposes of this study were to evaluate the frequency with which emergency physicians involved in residency leadership disclose potential malignancy risks from computed tomography (CT), assess comfort with these discussions, and evaluate factors influencing risk disclosure., METHODS: We surveyed emergency medicine residency program directors and associate/assistant directors. Primary outcome was the proportion who "almost always" or "most of the time" discussed potential risks., RESULTS: Two hundred and seventy-four (50.6%) of 542 eligible physicians responded. There were 82.1% (95% CI 76.8%, 86.6%) who reported almost always or most of the time discussing potential risks for patients <=18 years; proportions for adults 19-40, 41-65, and >65 years were 50.6% (95% CI 44.4, 56.7%), 20.7% (95% CI 16.0, 26.0%), and 5.2% (95% CI 2.9, 8.5%), respectively (test for trend, p < 0.001). The proportion reporting being "extremely" or "very" comfortable discussing risks was 57.1% (95% CI 51.1, 63.2%). Patient/family CT request that the physician felt was not indicated was of "very high" or "high" importance for driving risk discussions in 86.4% of respondents. For 75.5%, patient/family query about radiation risks was of "high" or "very high" importance. Among 57.4% of respondents, the patient being elderly and/or having a reduced life expectancy was of "high" or "very high" importance in the decision not to discuss risk., CONCLUSIONS: Emergency physicians involved in residency leadership report frequently disclosing potential malignancy risks from CT at frequencies inversely proportional to patient age. About half are comfortable with discussions, and many discussions are driven by patient requests. Opportunities exist to optimize and standardize emergency department CT radiation risk disclosure practices.

N2  - PURPOSE: As established by the AccreditationCouncil for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME),dermatology residents in the United States must participate in continuity clinic. This requirement may be achieved through multiple means, allowing for program variation. To better assess continuity clinic's role in resident learning, more data on this component of graduate medical education is needed., METHODS: An anonymous online survey was distributed via the American Board of Dermatology list serv to all U.S. dermatology residents. Continuity clinic organization, setting, frequency, and patient and preceptor characteristics were assessed; resident satisfaction and learning were compared., RESULTS: Of 231 responses, 7.8% reported continuity clinic daily, 77.1% weekly, 9.1% every other week, 3.0%monthly, 0.4% once every several months, and 2.2%only during certain blocks. Of the clinics reported,80.1% were "resident-run with attending" and 11.3%were attending-run. The rest were "resident-run with no attending" (0.9%), both resident and attending run(3.0%), or "other" (4.8%). Trainees in resident-run clinics (with attendings) reported greater continuity of care than those in attending-run clinics (p<0.001).Residents reported better teaching with attending presence during patient encounters than when attendings were present only if concerns were raised(p<0.01).

N2  - BACKGROUND: Chief Residents must lead, manage and mentor a diverse and often large group of residents, however there is a lack of formal leadership training throughout graduate medical education., OBJECTIVE: Development of a 3-part Chief Resident (CR) Program focused on leading, managing and mentoring., DESIGN: Each participant completes an Emotional Intelligence (EI) Inventory prior to the day-long event. Participants receive their EI scores at the beginning of the program, which features interactive sessions on leadership, management, and feedback skills. The program then reinforces the application of their new knowledge about EI through a four station OSTE (Observed Structured Teaching Encounter). CRs practice feedback and coaching skills in a simulated environment where they need to provide the context of formative feedback to a standardized resident., RESULTS: The aggregated mean pre-session EI score for all participants was 76.9 (an ideal score is >85). An independent-samples t-test compared the CRs' leadership and feedback performance on their first and second OSTE performance within a single afternoon session. There was a significant difference between the first OSTE performance (M = 47.92, SD = 7.8) and the second OSTE performance (M = 51.22, SD = 6.9); t (68) = 1.99, p = 0.006. These results suggest that participating in multiple OSTEs positively reinforces the core interpersonal and communication skills discussed in the didactic and practiced in the interactive portions of the program., CONCLUSION: The low mean pre-session EI score achieved by our participants supports the idea that CRs enter their new roles with a level of EI that can be enhanced. CRs had an overall positive reaction to EI and its application to the core skills addressed in the program, highlighting the fact that similar programs could be used to train early career physicians to be more skilled and comfortable with leading, managing and mentoring., ABBREVIATIONS: CR: Chief resident; EI: Emotional intelligence; GME: Graduate medical education; OSTE: Objective structured teaching encounter.

T1  - Medical Education and Leadership in Breastfeeding Medicine.

Y1  - 2017//
N2  - Physicians' experience with high quality training in breastfeeding during their medical education is historically varied. The process of becoming a board-certified physician entails more than 20 years of education, and although medical school and residency training timelines and courses are relatively standardized across the United States and even internationally, breastfeeding education varies greatly across schools and programs. The Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine (ABM) exists, in part, because historically, physicians have received too little clinical training in breastfeeding and infant nutrition. An overarching goal of ABM, which is a multispecialty organization of doctors around the world, is to educate all maternal-child healthcare professionals, not just physicians, about breastfeeding. Within the field of medicine, family doctors, pediatricians, and obstetrician/gynecologists are considered the most logical source of breastfeeding expertise. However, the need for breastfeeding education goes beyond those providers who have obvious interactions with mothers and babies. We must educate anesthesiologists, surgeons, internists, and psychiatrists, among others. Building pipelines of physicians who are well educated in breastfeeding medicine allows more effective collaboration and care of mothers and infants among providers in various medical and surgical specialties as well as between doctors and other healthcare providers. This evidence-based education needs to be multifaceted, with didactic curricula for a strong knowledge base complemented by clinical experiences for skill development and application. Clinical knowledge and skills can also be reinforced during nonclinical opportunities in teaching, research, advocacy, and professional development. In this article, we describe a foundational framework for physician education in breastfeeding medicine as well as several creative noncurricular opportunities to develop breastfeeding expertise in future physician leaders. We conclude with a case study.

N2  - The DNP curriculum prepares the graduate for evidence informed improvement translation through coursework integrating improvement, safety, and translation sciences. Innovative leadership skills are necessary to lead inter-professional unit-based and health system opportunities. Equipping the DNP with the necessary skills and competencies to accomplish any type of improvement translation requires exposure to the tools and techniques of these sciences with an emphasis in didactic content. With a foundational knowledge of the principles for improvement, translation and application will follow. It is imperative theoretical underpinnings of translational science are taught, and that the students be expected to apply these concepts in "real word" circumstances. Thus, the DNP student is afforded opportunities during their DNP program to participate in a "learning lab" for evidence informed improvement translation. In essence, the courses within the program are designed to allow conversion from theory into practice.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Recent trends in graduate medical education have emphasized the mastery of nontechnical skills, especially leadership, for neurosurgical trainees. Accordingly, we introduced leadership development and self-awareness training to interns attending the Society of Neurological Surgeons Post-Graduate Year 1 Boot Camp in the Northeast (New England/New York/New Jersey) region in 2015. Feedback about the session was collected from interns. While neurosurgical interns conveyed a desire to receive more information on improving their leadership skills, most indicated that guidance seemed to be lacking in this critical area. We discuss some of the professional development needs uncovered during this process.Copyright © 2017 by the Congress of Neurological Surgeons.

N2  - Background: The fact that medical treatment is associated with errors has long been recognized. Based on the principle of "first do no harm", numerous efforts have since been made to prevent such errors or limit their impact. However, recent statistics show that these measures do not sufficiently prevent grave mistakes with serious consequences. Preventable mistakes such as wrong patient or wrong site surgery still frequently occur in error statistics. Methods: Based on insight from research on human error, in due consideration of recent legislative regulations in Germany, the authors give an overview of the clinical risk management tools needed to identify risks in surgery, analyse their causes, and determine adequate measures to manage those risks depending on their relevance. The use and limitations of critical incident reporting systems (CIRS), safety checklists and crisis resource management (CRM) are highlighted. Also the rationale for IT systems to support the risk management process is addressed. Results/Conclusion: No single tool of risk management can be effective as a standalone instrument, but unfolds its effect only when embedded in a superordinate risk management system, which integrates tailor-made elements to increase patient safety into the workflows of each organisation. Competence in choosing adequate tools, effective IT systems to support the risk management process as well as leadership and commitment to constructive handling of human error are crucial components to establish a safety culture in surgery.Copyright Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart .

N2  - The primary goal of any radiology residency program is to train clinically competent radiologists. However, some radiology programs go above and beyond basic ACGME requirements and produce highly productive radiologists who contribute to the field in research, education and technology. At the core of such residencies are the people who comprise it, including self-motivated, personable residents and faculty who can facilitate excellence from their trainees. Indeed, radiology residencies which create unique programs in response to evolving resident interests can help foster resident-driven research, advocacy, technological innovation and early leadership. These unique programs, when interwoven with a strong educational foundation driven by evidence-based learning techniques and informatics-driven evaluation programs, function to produce highly competent clinicians who become leaders in the field.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Despite a wide implementation of pay-for-performance (P4P) programs, evidence on their impact in hospitals is still limited. Our objective was to assess the implementation of the French P4P pilot program (IFAQ1) across 222 hospitals. The study consisted of a questionnaire among four leaders in each enrolled hospital, combined with a qualitative analysis based on 33 semi-structured interviews conducted with staff in four participating hospitals. For the questionnaire results, descriptive statistics were performed and responses were analyzed by job title. For the interviews, transcripts were analysed using coding techniques. Survey results showed that leaders were mostly positive about the program and reported a good level of awareness, in contrast to the frontline staff, who remained mostly unaware of the program's existence. The main barriers were attributed to lack of clarity in program rules, and to time constraints. Different strategies were then suggested by leaders. The qualitative results added further explanations for low program adoption among hospital staff, so far. Ultimately, although paying for quality is still an intuitive approach; gaps in program awareness within enrolled hospitals may pose an important challenge to P4P efficacy. Implementation evaluations are therefore necessary for policymakers to better understand P4P adoption processes among hospitals.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  - BACKGROUND: There is an extreme health workforce shortage in Eastern, Central, and Southern Africa. Shortage of eye care workers impedes effective implementation of prevention of blindness programs. The World Health Organization has identified education, partnership, leadership, financing, and policy as intertwined interventions that are critical to resolving this crisis on the long term., CASE PRESENTATION: The VISION 2020 LINK between the College of Ophthalmology of Eastern, Central, and Southern Africa and the Royal College of Ophthalmologists in the United Kingdom aims to increase the quantity and quality of eye care training in East, Central, and Southern Africa through a focus on five strategic areas: fellowship examination for ophthalmologists, training the trainers, curriculum development for residents in ophthalmology and ophthalmic clinical officers, continuous professional development (CPD), and mentoring program for young ophthalmologists. This study examined how education and partnership can be linked to improve eye care, through an evaluation of this north-south link based on its own targets and established frameworks to guide north-south links., METHODS: An exploratory qualitative case study design was used. Twenty-nine link representatives were recruited through purposive sampling and snowballing. Face-to-face interviews were conducted using a semi-structured interview schedule that incorporated the components of a successful link from an existing framework. Documents pertaining to the link were also examined. Thematic analysis was used for data analysis., RESULTS: The findings revealed that the perception to the contribution of the link to eye care in the region is generally positive. Process indicators showed that the targets in three strategic objectives of the link have been achieved. Framework-based evaluation also showed that the link is successful. Mutual learning and development of friendships were the most commonly identified success factors. Inadequate awareness of the link by college members is a key challenge., CONCLUSION: The study concludes that the link is active and evolving and has achieved most of its targets. Further developments should be directed to influence health system strengthening in Eastern, Central, and Southern Africa more strategically. The study recommends expansion of the scope of collaboration to involve multiple health system building blocks.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to identify behaviors that faculty and residents exhibit during intraoperative interactions, which support or inhibit progressive entrustment leading to operative autonomy., BACKGROUND: In the operating room, a critical balance is sought between direct faculty supervision and appropriate increase in resident autonomy with indirect faculty supervision. Little is known regarding perspectives of faculty and residents about how attendings increasingly step back and safely delegate autonomy to trainees. Understanding the context in which these decisions are made is critical to achieving a safe strategy for imparting progressive responsibility., METHODS: A qualitative study was undertaken from January 2014 to February 2015. Semistructured interviews were conducted with 37 faculty and 59 residents from 14 and 41 institutions, respectively. Participants were selected using stratified random sampling from general surgery residency programs across the United States to represent a range of university, university-affiliated, and community programs, and geographic regions. Audio recordings of interviews were transcribed, iteratively analyzed, and emergent themes identified., RESULTS: Six themes were identified as influencing progressive entrustment in the operating room: optimizing faculty intraoperative feedback; policies and regulations affecting role of resident in the operating room; flexible faculty teaching strategies; context-specific variables; leadership opportunities for resident in the case; and safe struggle for resident when appropriate., CONCLUSIONS: Perspectives of faculty and residents while overlapping were different in emphasis. Better understanding faculty-resident interactions, individual behaviors, contextual influences, and national regulations that influence intraoperative education have the potential to significantly affect progressive entrustment in training paradigms.

Y1  - 2017//
N2  - BACKGROUND: Medical error is common in crises, and the majority of observed errors are nontechnical in nature. The long-term impact of teaching crisis nontechnical skills to residents has not been evaluated. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of simulation-based teaching of crisis nontechnical skills compared to controls one year after initial teaching., METHODS: This was a prospective study using both historical controls and a before-and-after methodology to evaluate the effect of a high-fidelity simulation curriculum that used crisis resource management principles to teach nontechnical skills. Postgraduate year 2 and 3 residents were invited to take part in a prospective training course over 2 years. The primary outcome was leader performance evaluated by expert raters using the previously validated 7-point Ottawa Global Rating Scale., RESULTS: Overall, 23 residents performed 30 simulations over the 2 years with the intervention group of 7 residents being assessed in both years. After adjustment, the postgraduate year 3 intervention group who received training the previous year had significantly higher overall performance scores than all postgraduate year 2 scores (1.09 95% confidence interval 0.70-1.47, P < .001) and the historical postgraduate year 3 cohort who received no prior training (1.20, 95% confidence interval 0.37-2.03, P = .005). There was no decay of skills noted over the course of the study., CONCLUSION: Postgraduate year 3 residents who had prior training had significantly improved crisis performance compared to historical postgraduate year 3 controls and untrained postgraduate year 2 residents. There were no significant differences between the crisis performance of postgraduate year 2 residents and the untrained postgraduate year 3 controls. This confirms the beneficial effect and long-term retention after crisis nontechnical skill training.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - A nurse residency program can support transition for new-to-specialty nurses but requires commitment of time and resources. This implementation project used a specialty residency program shown to be effective in a Burn Center, and translated it into the Emergency Department and Maternal Child Health area located within the same medical treatment facility. Preceptor survey responses and leadership assessment of program suitability provided data related to intervention impact. The evidence pertaining to developing specialty knowledge, skills, competency, and clinical reasoning validated program efficacy. Project outcomes justify investment in building a standardized transitional support system.

Y1  - 2017//
N2  - BACKGROUND: For the purpose of providing excellent patient care, residents need to be strong, effective leaders. The lack of clinical leadership is alarming given the detrimental effects on patient safety. The objective of the study was to assess whether a leadership training addressing transactional and transformational leadership enhances leadership skills in residents., METHODS: A volunteer sample of 57 residents from postgraduate year one to four was recruited across a range of medical specialties. The residents took part in an interventional controlled trial. The four-week IMPACT leadership training provided specific strategies for leadership in the clinical environment, addressing transactional (e.g. active control, contingent reward) and transformational leadership skills (e.g. appreciation, inspirational motivation). Transactional and transformational leadership skill performance was rated (1) on the Performance Scale by an external evaluator blinded to the study design and (2) self-assessed transformational and transactional leadership skills. Both measures contained items of the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire, with higher scores indicating greater leadership skills., RESULTS: Both scores were significantly different between the IMPACT group and the control group. In the IMPACT group, the Performance Scale increased 15% in transactional leadership skill performance (2.10 to 2.86) (intervention effect, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.40 to 1.13; p < .001, eta2 = 0.31) and 14% in transformational leadership skill performance (2.26 to 2.94) (intervention effect, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.27 to 1.09; p < .001, eta2 = 0.22). The self-assessed transactional skills revealed a 4% increase (3.83 to 4.03) (intervention effect, 0.20; 95% CI, 0.08 to 0.33; p < .001, eta2 = 0.18) and a 6% increase in transformational leadership skills (3.54 to 3.86) (intervention effect, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.02 to 0.40; p< .001, eta2 = 0.53)., DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the use of the transactional and transformational leadership framework for graduate leadership training. Future studies should incorporate time-latent post-tests, evaluating the stability of the behavioral performance increase.

N2  - Introduction We investigated the preferences of medical residents in Germany with regard to future working place (hospital or private practice) and position (employment/self-employment in private practice; resp. specialist/senior or chief physician in the hospital). This is analysed in a gender comparative perspective, including the influence of parenthood. Methods Annual postal surveys among graduates of seven medical faculties in Germany from their last year ("Practical Year") until after four years of postgraduate training. The return rate at baseline was 48 % and the four surveys after reached rates from 85 % up. In all samples about two thirds were women, which corresponds to the actual gender differentiation in under- and postgraduate training. Descriptive statistics and regression analyses were performed. Results Compared to private practice the hospital is clearly preferred, although the attraction of hospital jobs decreased over the years. The decision for or against the hospital is connected to the discipline. Working in private practice is seen as possibility for part time work. Men prefer self-employment whereas women prefer to work under an employment contract. In the hospital, male doctors prefer to work in leading positions. Those positions are associated with full-time work. Leadership training especially takes place in university hospitals. Discussion Three trends are recognized: Reluctance against leading positions, growing interest for part time work and rising popularity of work as an employee in private practice. Those trends can be understood as a rejection of traditional professional role models. The realization of these preferences is easily feasible because of the current labour market situation. Therefore, emerging problems have to be faced in another way. A change of gender-typical role models was rarely detected.Copyright © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart . New York.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Residency programs have been integral to the development, expansion and progression of family medicine as a discipline. Three reports formed the foundation for graduate medical education in family medicine: Meeting the Challenge of Family Practice, The Graduate Education of Physicians, and Health is a Community Affair. In addition, the original core concepts of comprehensiveness, coordination, continuity, and patient centeredness continue to serve as the foundation for residency training in family medicine. While the Residency Review Committee for Family Medicine of the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education has provided the requirements for training throughout the years, key organizations including the Society of Teachers of Family Medicine, the American Academy of Family Physicians, the Association of Family Medicine Residency Directors, and the American Board of Family Medicine have provided resources for and supported innovation in programs. Residency Program Solutions, National Institute for Program Director Development, and Family Medicine Residency Curriculum Resource are several of the resources developed by these organizations. The future of family medicine residency training should continue the emphasis on innovation and development of resources to enhance the training of residents. Areas for further development include leadership and health care systems training that allows residents to assume leadership of multidisciplinary health care teams and increase focus on the family medicine practice population as the main unit for resident education.

N2  - Although residency training offers numerous leadership opportunities, most residents are not exposed to scripted leadership instruction. To explore one program's attitudes about leadership training, a group of otolaryngology faculty (n = 14) and residents (n = 17) was polled about their attitudes. In terms of self-perception, more faculty (10 of 14, 71.4%) than residents (9 of 17, 52.9%; P = .461) considered themselves good leaders. The majority of faculty and residents (27 of 31) thought that adults could be taught leadership ability. Given attitudes about leadership ability and the potential for improvement through instruction, consideration should be given to including such training in otolaryngology residency.

Y1  - 2017//
N2  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the current status of leadership training as perceived by family medicine residents to inform the development of a formal leadership curriculum., DESIGN: Cross-sectional quantitative survey., SETTING: Department of Family Medicine at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ont, in December 2013., PARTICIPANTS: A total of 152 first- and second-year family medicine residents., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Family medicine residents' attitudes toward leadership, perceived level of training in various leadership domains, and identified opportunities for leadership training., RESULTS: Overall, 80% (152 of 190) of residents completed the survey. On a Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree, 4 = neutral, 7 = strongly agree), residents rated the importance of physician leadership in the clinical setting as high (6.23 of 7), whereas agreement with the statement "I am a leader" received the lowest rating (5.28 of 7). At least 50% of residents desired more training in the leadership domains of personal mastery, mentorship and coaching, conflict resolution, teaching, effective teamwork, administration, ideals of a healthy workplace, coalitions, and system transformation. At least 50% of residents identified behavioural sciences seminars, a lecture and workshop series, and a retreat as opportunities to expand leadership training., CONCLUSION: The concept of family physicians as leaders resonated highly with residents. Residents desired more personal and system-level leadership training. They also identified ways that leadership training could be expanded in the current curriculum and developed in other areas. The information gained from this survey might facilitate leadership development among residents through application of its results in a formal leadership curriculum.Copyright© the College of Family Physicians of Canada.

T1  - Making Management Skills a Core Component of Medical Education.
A1  - Myers, Christopher G
A1  - Pronovost, Peter J
Y1  - 2017//
N2  - Physicians are being called upon to engage in greater leadership and management in increasingly complex and dynamic health care organizations. Yet, management skills are largely undeveloped in medical education. Without formal management training in the medical curriculum, physicians are left to cultivate their leadership and management abilities through a haphazard array of training programs or simply through trial and error, with consequences that may range from frustration among staff to reduced quality of care and increased risk of patient harm. To address this issue, the authors posit that medical education needs a more systematic focus on topics related to management and organization, such as individual decision making, interpersonal communication, team knowledge sharing, and organizational culture. They encourage medical schools to partner with business school faculty or other organizational scholars to offer a "Management 101" course in the medical curriculum to provide physicians-in-training with an understanding of these topics and raise the quality of physician leadership and management in modern health care organizations.

T1  - Doctors Without Borders.
A1  - Wass, Val

Y1  - 2017//
N2  - The unprecedented demands of patient and population priorities created by globalization and escalating health and social inequities will not be met unless medical education changes. Educators have failed to move fast enough to create an education framework that meets current population needs. A new common set of professional values around global social accountability is necessary. Education borders must be broken down at three levels-societal-institutional, interpersonal, and individual.At a societal-institutional level, global health must be embraced as part of a philosophy of population needs, human rights, equity, and justice. A move from informative acquisition of knowledge and skills to formative learning where students socialize around values, develop leadership attributes, and become agents for change is needed. At an interpersonal level, radical changes in curriculum delivery, which move away from the well-defined borders of specialty rotations, are required. Students must develop an integrated understanding of the future of health care and the patient's journey through health care delivery, within the context of population needs. At an individual level, doctors need to understand the boundaries of the professional values they hold within themselves and develop a deeper understanding of their own internal prejudices and conflicts. Opening the borders between the sciences and humanities is essential. Fostering and mentoring that emphasize that resilience, leadership, flexibility, and the ability to cope with uncertainty are needed to tackle the complexities of current, as well as future, health care. Doctors need to understand the restraints within themselves to work effectively without borders.

Y1  - 2017//
N2  - Learners are a pillar of academic medicine, yet their voice is seldom heard in national and international scholarly conversations on medical education. However, learners are eager to contribute: in response to a recent open call from Academic Medicine, medical students and residents representing 98 institutions across 11 countries submitted 224 Letters to the Editor on wide-ranging topics. In this Invited Commentary, the authors-three medical students serving in national leadership roles-contextualize several themes discussed in these learner-authored letters.The authors first explore the unique voice learners contribute to educational innovation, highlighting the value learners add to curricular and systemic educational reform efforts. They then turn to the broader implications of the many submitted letters addressing the culture and humanism of medicine, proposing that learners can be powerful catalysts and partners in cultural change. Despite these benefits, the authors note that learners are largely untapped change agents who are particularly underrepresented in medical education scholarship, finding that students were just 2.8% (39/1,396) of authors and 3.5% (12/340) of first authors among all print publications in Academic Medicine in 2016. The authors conclude by offering tangible steps for the academic medical community to engage learners in leadership, advocacy, and scholarship.

N2  - PROBLEM: Health disparities are pervasive worldwide. Physicians have a unique vantage point from which they can observe the ways social, economic, and political factors impact health outcomes and can be effective advocates for enhanced health outcomes and health equity. However, social medicine and health advocacy curricula are uncommon in postgraduate medical education., APPROACH: In academic year (AY) 2012, the Cambridge Health Alliance internal medicine residency program transformed an elective into a required social medicine and research-based health advocacy curriculum. The course has three major innovations: it has a yearlong longitudinal curriculum, it is required for all residents, and all residents complete a group research-based health advocacy project within the curricular year. The authors describe the structure, content, and goals of this curriculum., OUTCOMES: Over the last four years (AYs 2012-2015), residents (17/32; 53%) have rated the overall quality of the course highly (mean = 5.2, where 6 = outstanding; standard deviation = 0.64). In each year since the new course has been implemented, all scholarly work from the course has been presented at conferences by 31 resident presenters and/or coauthors. The course seems to enhance the residency program's capacity to recruit high-caliber residents and faculty members., NEXT STEPS: The authors are collecting qualitative and quantitative data on the impact of the course. They will use their findings to advocate for a national health advocacy competency framework. Recommendations about how to initiate or further develop social medicine and health advocacy curricula are offered.

Y1  - 2017//
N2  - INTRODUCTION: Emergency medicine (EM) fellowships are becoming increasingly numerous, and there is a growing trend among EM residents to pursue postgraduate fellowship training. Scant data have been published on the prevalence of postgraduate training among emergency physicians. We aimed to describe the prevalence and regional variation of fellowships among EM residency leadership., METHODS: We conducted an online anonymous survey that was sent to the Council of EM Residency Directors (CORD) membership in October 2014. The survey was a brief questionnaire, which inquired about fellowship, secondary board certification, gender, and length in a leadership position of each member of its residency leadership. We separated the responses to the survey into four different geographic regions. The geographic regions were defined by the same classification used by the National Resident Matching Program (NRMP). We defined residency leadership as program director (PD), associate PD and assistant PD. Residencies that did not complete the survey were then individually contacted to encourage completion. The survey was initially piloted for ease of use and understanding of the questions with a select few EM PDs., RESULTS: We obtained responses from 145 of the 164 Accrediting Council for Graduate Medical Education-accredited EM residencies (88%). The fellowship prevalence among PDs, associate PDs, and assistant PDs was 21.4%, 20.3%, and 24.9% respectively. The most common fellowship completed was a fellowship in toxicology. Secondary board certification among PDs, associate PDs, and assistant PDs was 9.7%, 4.8%, and 2.9% respectively. Eighty-two percent of PDs have at least five years in residency leadership. Seventy-six percent of PDs were male, and there was a near-even split of gender among associate PDs and assistant PDs. The Western region had the highest percentage of fellowship and or secondary board certification among all levels of residency leadership., CONCLUSION: There is a low prevalence of fellowship training and secondary board certification among EM residency leadership, with the most common being toxicology. Assistant PDs, the majority of whom had less than five years residency leadership experience, had the highest percentage of fellowship training. There may be a regional variation in the percentage of residency leadership completing postgraduate training.

T1  - "The Actualized Neurosurgeon": A Proposed Model of Surgical Resident Development.
A1  - Lipsman, Nir

A1  - Kulkarni, Abhaya V
Y1  - 2017//
N2  - BACKGROUND: Modern neurosurgical training is both physically and emotionally demanding, posing significant challenges, new and old, to residents as well as programs attempting to train safe, competent surgeons. Models to describe resident development, such as the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education competencies and milestones, address the acquisition of specific skills but largely ignore the stresses and pressures unique to each stage of resident training., METHODS: We propose an alternative model of resident development adapted from the developmental psychology literature., RESULTS: Our model identifies the challenges that must be met at each stage of junior, intermediate, and senior and chief residency, leading ultimately to an "actualized" neurosurgeon (i.e., one who has maximized his or her potential). Failure to overcome any 1 of these challenges can lead to specific long-lasting consequences, including regret, identity crisis, incompetence, and bitterness. In contrast, the actualized surgeon is one who has successfully acquired the virtues of hope, will, purpose, fidelity, productivity, leadership, competence, and wisdom. The actualized surgeon not only functions safely, confidently, and professionally, but also successfully navigates the challenges of residency and emerges from them having fulfilled his or her maximal potential., CONCLUSIONS: This developmental perspective provides an individualized description of healthy surgical development. Our model allows programs to identify the basis for residents who fail to progress, counsel residents during their training, and perhaps help identify resident candidates who are better prepared to meet the developmental challenges of residency training.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

A1  - Fahy, Brenda G
Y1  - 2017//
N2  - BACKGROUND: Anesthesiology residency primarily emphasizes the development of medical knowledge and technical skills. Yet, nontechnical skills (NTS) are also vital to successful clinical practice. Elements of NTS are communication, teamwork, situational awareness, and decision making., METHODS: The first 10 consecutive senior residents who chose to participate in this 2-week elective rotation of operating room (OR) management and leadership training were enrolled in this study, which spanned from March 2013 to March 2015. Each resident served as the anesthesiology officer of the day (AOD) and was tasked with coordinating OR assignments, managing care for 2 to 4 ORs, and being on call for the trauma OR; all residents were supervised by an attending AOD. Leadership and NTS techniques were taught via a standardized curriculum consisting of leadership and team training articles, crisis management text, and daily debriefings. Resident self-ratings and attending AOD and charge nurse raters used the Anaesthetists' Non-Technical Skills (ANTS) scoring system, which involved task management, situational awareness, teamwork, and decision making. For each of the 10 residents in their third year of clinical anesthesiology training (CA-3) who participated in this elective rotation, there were 14 items that required feedback from resident self-assessment and OR raters, including the daily attending AOD and charge nurse. Results for each of the items on the questionnaire were compared between the beginning and the end of the rotation with the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for matched samples. Comparisons were run separately for attending AOD and charge nurse assessments and resident self-assessments. Scaled rankings were analyzed for the Kendall coefficient of concordance (omega) for rater agreement with associated chi and P value., RESULTS: Common themes identified by the residents during debriefings were recurrence of challenging situations and the skills residents needed to instruct and manage clinical teams. For attending AOD and charge nurse assessments, resident performance of NTS improved from the beginning to the end of the rotation on 12 of the 14 NTS items (P < .05), whereas resident self-assessment improved on 3 NTS items (P < .05). Interrater reliability (across the charge nurse, resident, and AOD raters) ranged from omega = .36 to .61 at the beginning of the rotation and omega = .27 to .70 at the end of the rotation., CONCLUSIONS: This rotation allowed for teaching and resident assessment to occur in a way that facilitated resident education in several of the skills required to meet specific milestones. Resident physicians are able to foster NTS and build a framework for clinical leadership when completing a 2-week senior elective as an OR manager.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To determine pharmacist career paths and resident perceptions after completion of a PGY1 community pharmacy residency with a national supermarket pharmacy chain., METHODS: Cross-sectional nationwide survey., RESULTS: Overall, 65% (n = 24) of residents who responded accepted a position with Kroger immediately after graduation. When asked about the degree of value the residency had on obtaining the resident's ideal position, 29 (76%) reported that it was "very valuable" and the remaining 9 (24%) reported that it was "somewhat valuable." Positions that these pharmacists held immediately after residency completion were: clinical pharmacist (clinical coordinators, patient care specialists, or patient care managers; 54%), staff pharmacist (21%), split/mixed (mixed clinical and staffing components; 21%), and pharmacy manager (4%)., CONCLUSION: Residency trained pharmacists were retained by the pharmacy chain where they practiced, and the majority of those pharmacists held split or full-time clinical pharmacist roles within the chain supermarket pharmacy.Copyright © 2017 American Pharmacists Association.

N2  - BACKGROUND: To provide junior doctors with tools to improve patient care in their workplace, a partnership was developed between the Clinical Excellence Commission (CEC) and the Royal Australasian College of Physicians (RACP) to help trainee consultants carry out clinical practice improvement (CPI) projects during clinical work., METHODS: Based on a patient-care problem they wished to resolve, trainee consultants attended a 2-day face-to-face workshop to learn quality-improvement methods, describe their proposals and refine them using CPI methodology. They were provided with continuing supervision, participated in a mid-point review and were responsible for driving their projects. Trainee consultants attended a 2-day face-to-face workshop to learn quality-improvement methods RESULTS: Examples of five projects are: reducing mislabelled specimens leaving an emergency department, from 82 in the baseline period to 18 following the intervention; creating a multidisciplinary team to reduce hypoglycaemic episodes on a diabetic ward, from 23 episodes at baseline to three episodes over the same time period after the intervention; establishing an acute paediatric review clinic that reduced avoidable admissions of pneumonia by 74 per cent; providing 100 per cent of patients in a palliative care unit with an effective pain-management plan; developing an education package to increase staff confidence in recognising and responding to anaphylaxis in children, producing an increase in confidence from 51 per cent at baseline to 100 per cent after the intervention., DISCUSSION: Involving a learned college such as the RACP in patient-care improvement, with educational input from a partner organisation, shows how junior staff can become effective leaders in improving patient care.Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Nearly half of graduates of American medical colleges are women, yet the percentage of women entering accredited anesthesiology programs remains less than 40%. There are obviously many factors that influence the choice of a residency training program, from geography to reputation to the atmosphere, composition and camaraderie of the department. We examined whether a greater number of current female residents, a female Chair, or a female Program Director were associated with a program matching a greater number of female candidates in the 2014 NRMP Match., METHODS: An electronic questionnaire was sent to all 132 ACGME-accredited anesthesiology programs immediately following the 2014 Match seeking information on the gender mix of their current residents, the gender of the Chair and Program Director, and the gender composition of their newly-matched candidates., RESULTS: The percentage of current female residents was significantly associated with the percentage of incoming female residents (p = 0.013). There was no association between the percentage of new female residents obtained in the Match and the presence of a female Chair or Program Director., CONCLUSIONS: The results of the 2013 NRMP anesthesiology match indicate that programs with a higher proportion of female residents were able to sustain that diversity and successfully match a higher percentage of female candidates. No correlation was seen with Chair and Program Director gender, suggesting further work is needed to define the influence of female role models on female applicants' choice of anesthesiology residency programs.

Y1  - 2016//
N2  - Purpose: To describe an innovative strategy for incorporating leadership training and development across multiple postgraduate year 2 (PGY2) pharmacy residency programs at a single institution. Background: Tampa General Hospital has 7 pharmacy residency positions: 4 postgraduate year 1 (PGY1) residents and a single resident for each of the 3 PGY2 programs (critical care, emergency medicine, and solid organ transplant). Administrative topics are incorporated across the PGY1 and PGY2 residency programs, with each PGY2 program having additional administrative topics specific to their specialty area. Summary: What began as an elective administrative topic discussion for the PGY2 emergency medicine resident has evolved over time into a longitudinal leadership book club. The leadership book club is utilized to meet the residency goals and objectives related to leadership development for all 3 PGY2 programs. Each year a single book is identified through the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) Leadership Academy book list or by participant suggestion. The book is then divided into 4 sections with corresponding hour-long discussions that occur quarterly throughout the residency year. The residency program directors (RPDs) and co-RPDs lead the initial discussion, and each PGY2 resident leads 1 of the subsequent 3 discussions. Based on resident feedback, the leadership book club is an innovative and effective strategy to incorporate leadership training and development into residency training. Conclusion: It is imperative to foster the development of leadership skills in pharmacy residency programs to prevent a future leadership gap in health system pharmacy. Leadership book club is a unique strategy to incorporate leadership training longitudinally across multiple PGY2 residency programs at a single institution.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To describe and evaluate an innovative approach for developing leadership skills in a cohort of medical students through an extracurricular programme., METHODS: The study was conducted at King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, from April to June of the academic year 2014-15, and comprised medical students from all batches. Mixed-method design was used to evaluate the leadership development programme. Pre- and post-tests were conducted to assess students' learning and their satisfaction was evaluated at the end of the programme. Focus groups were conducted to assess the programme's impact on participants' behaviour. Data analysis was done using SPSS 16., RESULTS: Of the 55 participants, 45(82%) responded to the evaluation survey. Of them, 29(65%) reported intended changes in their leadership practices immediately after the programme, with 8(28%) of them reporting more than one change. The mean students' satisfaction with the overall performance of the speakers and programme organisation was high at 4.12+/-0.91 and 4.54+/-0.89, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: Early experience of the leadership development programme produced positive results. An intense programme analysis is required to fully understand this significant organisational need.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Leadership has been identified as an important attribute for health care professionals. Assessing leadership practices can help identify areas of strength or needed improvement for the development of leaders., OBJECTIVES: To describe the perceived leadership practices of year-1 Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT) students, to determine if the participants' demographic variables were related to their perceived leadership practices, and to explore differences between participants and the general population., METHODS: The Leadership Practices Inventory (LPI Self) developed by Kouzes and Posner was used to assess leadership practices of year-1 DPT students at six Midwestern universities., RESULTS: The leadership practices of 192 DPT students in highest to lowest order were Enable, Encourage, Model, Challenge, and Inspire. Age was found to be significantly correlated with the Challenge leadership practice. The order and means of some leadership practices of the DPT students were different than the general population., CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a baseline description of how year-1 DPT students perceived their leadership behaviors and how the LPI Self can be used to facilitate the development of leadership skills.

T1  - Evaluating a physician leadership development program - a mixed methods approach.
A1  - Throgmorton, Cheryl
A1  - Mitchell, Trey
A1  - Morley, Tom
A1  - Snyder, Marijo
Y1  - 2016//
N2  - Purpose - With the extent of change in healthcare today, organizations need strong physician leaders. To compensate for the lack of physician leadership education, many organizations are sending physicians to external leadership programs or developing in-house leadership programs targeted specifically to physicians. The purpose of this paper is to outline the evaluation strategy and outcomes of the inaugural year of a Physician Leadership Academy (PLA) developed and implemented at a Michigan-based regional healthcare system. Design/methodology/approach - The authors applied the theoretical framework of Kirkpatrick's four levels of evaluation and used surveys, observations, activity tracking, and interviews to evaluate the program outcomes. The authors applied grounded theory techniques to the interview data. Findings - The program met targeted outcomes across all four levels of evaluation. Interview themes focused on the significance of increasing self-awareness, building relationships, applying new skills, and building confidence. Research limitations/implications - While only one example, this study illustrates the importance of developing the evaluation strategy as part of the program design. Qualitative research methods, often lacking from learning evaluation design, uncover rich themes of impact. The study supports how a PLA program can enhance physician learning, engagement, and relationship building throughout and after the program. Physician leaders' partnership with organization development and learning professionals yield results with impact to individuals, groups, and the organization. Originality/value - Few studies provide an in-depth review of evaluation methods and outcomes of physician leadership development programs. Healthcare organizations seeking to develop similar in-house programs may benefit applying the evaluation strategy outlined in this study.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Despite increased attention to communication skill training in palliative care, few interprofessional training programs are available and little is known about the impact of such training., OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated a communication curriculum offered to interprofessional palliative care teams and examined the longitudinal impact of training., METHODS: Interprofessional, hospital-based palliative care team members were competitively selected to participate in a two-day training using the COMFORT(TM SM) (Communication, Orientation and options, Mindful communication, Family, Openings, Relating, Team) Communication for Palliative Care Teams curriculum. Course evaluation and goal assessment were tracked at six and nine months postcourse. Interprofessional palliative care team members (n=58) representing 29 teams attended the course and completed course goals. Participants included 28 nurses, 16 social workers, 8 physicians, 5 chaplains, and one psychologist. Precourse surveys assessed participants' perceptions of institution-wide communication performance across the continuum of care and resources supporting optimum communication. Postcourse evaluations and goal progress monitoring were used to assess training effectiveness., RESULTS: Participants reported moderate communication effectiveness in their institutions, with the weakest areas being during bereavement and survivorship care. Mean response to course evaluation across all participants was greater than 4 (scale of 1=low to 5=high). Participants taught an additional 962 providers and initiated institution-wide training for clinical staff, new hires, and volunteers. Team member training improved communication processes and increased attention to communication with family caregivers. Barriers to goal implementation included a lack of institutional support as evidenced in clinical caseloads and an absence of leadership and funding., CONCLUSION: The COMFORT(TM SM) communication curriculum is effective palliative care communication training for interprofessional teams.

Y1  - 2016//
N2  - Purpose The purpose of this study is to discern the physicians' perception of leadership effectiveness in their clinical and non-clinical roles (leadership) by identifying their political skill levels. Design/methodology/approach A sample of 209 Canadian physicians was surveyed using the Political Skills Inventory (PSI) during the period 2012-2014. The PSI was chosen because it assesses leadership effectiveness on four dimensions: social astuteness, interpersonal influence, networking ability and apparent authenticity. Findings Physicians in clinical roles' PSI scores were significantly lower in all four PSI dimensions when compared to all other physicians in non-clinical roles, with the principal difference being in their networking abilities. Practical implications More emphasis is needed on educating and training physicians, specifically in the areas of political skills, in current clinical roles if they are to assume leadership roles and be effective. Originality/value Although this study is located in Canada, the study design and associated findings may have implications to other areas and countries wanting to increase physician leadership effectiveness. Further, replication of this study in other settings may provide insight into the future design of physician leadership training curriculum.

N2  - Purpose This paper aims to highlight the importance of leadership development for all physicians within a competency-based medical education (CBME) framework. It describes the importance of timely international collaboration as a key strategy in promoting physician leadership development. Design/methodology/approach The paper explores published and Grey literature around physician leadership development and proposes that international collaboration will meet the expanding call for development of leadership competencies in postgraduate medical learners. Two grounding frameworks were used: complexity science supports adding physician leadership training to the current momentum of CBME adoption, and relational cultural theory supports the engagement of diverse stakeholders in multiple jurisdictions around the world to ensure inclusivity in leadership education development. Findings An international collaborative identified key insights regarding the need to frame physician leadership education within a competency-based model. Practical implications International collaboration can be a vehicle for developing a globally relevant, generalizable physician leadership curriculum. This model can be expanded to encourage innovation, scholarship and program evaluation. Originality/value A competency-based leadership development curriculum is being designed by an international collaborative. The curriculum is based on established leadership and education frameworks. The international collaboration model provides opportunities for ongoing sharing, networking and diversification.

T1  - Can complexity science inform physician leadership development?.
A1  - Grady, Colleen Marie
Y1  - 2016//
N2  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to describe research that examined physician leadership development using complexity science principles. Design/methodology/approach Intensive interviewing of 21 participants and document review provided data regarding physician leadership development in health-care organizations using five principles of complexity science (connectivity, interdependence, feedback, exploration-of-the-space-of-possibilities and co-evolution), which were grouped in three areas of inquiry (relationships between agents, patterns of behaviour and enabling functions). Findings Physician leaders are viewed as critical in the transformation of healthcare and in improving patient outcomes, and yet significant challenges exist that limit their development. Leadership in health care continues to be associated with traditional, linear models, which are incongruent with the behaviour of a complex system, such as health care. Physician leadership development remains a low priority for most health-care organizations, although physicians admit to being limited in their capacity to lead. This research was based on five principles of complexity science and used grounded theory methodology to understand how the behaviours of a complex system can provide data regarding leadership development for physicians. The study demonstrated that there is a strong association between physician leadership and patient outcomes and that organizations play a primary role in supporting the development of physician leaders. Findings indicate that a physician's relationship with their patient and their capacity for innovation can be extended as catalytic behaviours in a complex system. The findings also identified limiting factors that impact physicians who choose to lead, such as reimbursement models that do not place value on leadership and medical education that provides minimal opportunity for leadership skill development. Practical Implications This research provides practical applications for physician leadership development and emphasizes that it is incumbent upon physicians and organizations to focus attention on this to achieve improved patient and organizational outcomes. Originality/value This study pairing complexity science and physician leadership represents a unique way to view the development of physician leaders within the context of the complex system that is health care.

N2  - Purpose Physicians are often ill-equipped for the leadership activities their work demands. In part, this is due to a gap in traditional medical education. An emergent international network is developing a globally relevant leadership curriculum for postgraduate medical education. The purpose of this article is to share key learnings from this process to date. Design/methodology/approach The Toronto International Summit on Leadership Education for Physicians (TISLEP) was hosted by the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada, and the University of Toronto's Faculty of Medicine and Institute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation. Of 64 attendees from eight countries, 34 joined working groups to develop leadership competencies. The CanMEDS Competency Framework, stage of learner development and venue of learning formed the scaffold for the work. Emotional intelligence was selected as the topic to test the feasibility of fruitful international collaboration; results were presented at TISLEP 2015. Findings Dedicated international stakeholders engaged actively and constructively through defined working groups to develop a globally relevant, competency-based curriculum for physician leadership education. Eleven principles are recommended for consideration in physician leadership curriculum development. Defining common language and taxonomy is essential for a harmonized product. The importance of establishing an international network to support implementation, evaluation, sustainability and dissemination of the work was underscored. Originality/value International stakeholders are collaborating successfully on a graduated, competency-based leadership curriculum for postgraduate medical learners. The final product will be available for adaptation to local needs. An international physician leadership education network is being developed to support and expand the work underway.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Challenges in healthcare demand great leadership. In response, leadership training programs have been developed within academic medical centers, business schools, and healthcare organizations; however, we are unaware of any well-developed programs for physicians-in-training., METHODS: To address this gap, we developed a two-day leadership development course for chief residents (CRs) at the Cleveland Clinic, framed around the concept of emotional intelligence. This paper describes our five-year experience with the CRs leadership program., RESULTS: Since inception, 105 CRs took the course; 81 (77%) completed before-and-after evaluations. Participants indicated that they had relatively little prior knowledge of the concepts that were presented and that the workshop greatly enhanced their familiarity with leadership competencies. Qualitative analysis of open-ended responses indicated that attendees valued the training, especially in conflict resolution and teamwork, and indicated specific action plans for applying these skills. Furthermore, the workshop spurred some participants to express plans to learn more about leadership competencies., CONCLUSIONS: This study extends prior experience in offering an emotional intelligence-based leadership workshop for CRs. Though the program is novel, further research is needed to more fully understand the impact of leadership training for CRs and for the institutions and patients they serve.Copyright © The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists 2016.

N2  - Engaging physicians in hand hygiene programs is a challenge faced by many academic medical centers. Partnerships between education and academic leaders present opportunities for effective collaboration and improvement. The authors developed a robust hand hygiene quality improvement program, with attention to rapid-cycle improvements, including all levels of staff and health care providers. The program included a defined governance structure, clear data collection process, educational interventions, rapid-cycle improvements, and financial incentive for staff and physicians (including residents and fellows). Outcomes were measured on patients in all clinical areas. Run charts were used to document compliance in aggregate and by subgroups throughout the project duration. Institutional targets were achieved and then exceeded, with sustained hand hygiene compliance >90%. Physician compliance lagged behind aggregate compliance but ultimately was sustained at a level exceeding the target. Successfully achieving the institutional goal required collaboration among all stakeholders. Physician-specific data and physician champions were essential to drive improvement.Copyright © The Author(s) 2015.

N2  - The objective was to determine if a year-long, multispecialty resident and fellow quality improvement (QI) curriculum is feasible and leads to improvements in QI beliefs and self-reported behaviors. The Armstrong Institute Resident/Fellow Scholars (AIRS) curriculum incorporated (a) a 2-day workshop in lean sigma methodology, (b) year-long interactive weekly small-group lectures, (c) mentored QI projects, and (d) practicum-based components to observe frontline QI efforts. Pre-post evaluation was performed with the Quality Improvement Knowledge Application Tool (QIKAT) and the Systems Thinking Scale (STS) using the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test. Sixteen residents and fellows started the AIRS curriculum and 14 finished. Scholars' pre and post mean scores significantly improved: STS 3.06 pre versus 3.60 post (P < .01) and QIKAT 1.24 pre versus 2.46 post (P < .01). Most scholars (92%) agreed that skills learned in the curriculum will help in their future careers. A multispecialty QI curriculum for trainees is feasible and increases QI beliefs and self-reported behaviors. Copyright © The Author(s) 2015.

A1  - Olsen, Oystein Evjen
Y1  - 2016//
N2  - INTRODUCTION: Clinical leadership has long been recognised as critical for optimising patient safety, quality of care and interprofessional teamwork in busy and stressful healthcare settings. There is a need to compensate for the absence of the conventional mentor-to-apprentice transfer of clinical leadership knowledge and skills. While young doctors and nurses are increasingly proficient in medical, surgical and technical skills, their training in, and knowledge of clinical leadership skills, is not adequate to meet the demands for these non-technical skills in the emergency department. Thus, the purpose of the paper is to present and discuss the study protocol of clinical leadership in a course for teams that aims to improve quality, efficiency, responsiveness of healthcare services and collegial trust in the emergency department., METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The study employs a trailing research design using multiple quantitative and qualitative methods in the summative (pretest and post-test) and formative evaluation. Quantitative data have been collected from a patient questionnaire, the emergency departments' database and by the observation of team performance. Qualitative data have been collected by shadowing healthcare professionals and through focus group interviews. To ensure trustworthiness in the data analysis, we will apply member checks and analyst triangulation, in addition to providing contextual and sample description to allow for evaluation of transferability of our results to other contexts and groups., ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study is approved by the ethics committee of the western part of Norway and the hospital. The study is based on voluntary participation and informed written consent. Informants can withdraw at any point in time. The results will be disseminated at research conferences, peer review journals and through public presentations to people outside the scientific community.Copyright Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

N2  - Objective: To develop an educational intervention that targets residents' beliefs and attitudes to quality Improvement (QI) and leadership in order to demonstrate proactive behaviour., Design: Theory-driven, mixed methods study including document analysis, interviews, observations and open-ended questionnaires., Setting: Six Dutch teaching hospitals., Intervention: Using expertise from medicine, psychology, organizational and educational sciences we developed a situated learning programme named Ponder and IMProve (PIMP). The acronym PIMP reflects the original upbeat name in Dutch, Verwonder & Verbeter. It has a modern, positive meaning that relates to improving your current circumstances. In quarterly 1-h sessions residents are challenged to identify daily workplace frustrations and translate them into small-scale QI activities., Main outcome measures: Organizational awareness, beliefs and attitudes to QI and organizational responsibilities, resident behaviour, barriers and facilitators to successful learning and the programme's potential impact on the organization., Results: Overall, 19 PIMP meetings were held over a period of 3 years. Residents defined 119 PIMP goals, resolved 37 projects and are currently working on another 39 projects. Interviews show that PIMP sessions make residents more aware of the organizational aspects of their daily work. Moreover, residents feel empowered to take up the role of change agent. Facilitators for success include a positive cost-benefit trade-off, a valuable group process and a safe learning environment., Conclusion: This article demonstrates the added value of multidisciplinary theory-driven research for the design, development and evaluation of educational programmes. Residents can be encouraged to develop organizational awareness and reshape their daily frustrations in QI work.Copyright © The Author 2016.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Limited data exist on how to develop resident leadership and communication skills during actual trauma resuscitations., METHODS: An evaluation tool was developed to grade senior resident performance as the team leader during full-trauma-team activations. Thirty actions that demonstrated the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education core competencies were graded on a Likert scale of 1 (poor) to 5 (exceptional). These actions were grouped by their respective core competencies on 5 x 7-inch index cards. In Phase 1, baseline performance scores were obtained. In Phase 2, trauma-focused communication in-services were conducted early in the academic year, and immediate, personalized feedback sessions were performed after resuscitations based on the evaluation tool. In Phase 3, residents received only evaluation-based feedback following resuscitations., RESULTS: In Phase 1 (October 2009 to April 2010), 27 evaluations were performed on 10 residents. In Phase 2 (April 2010 to October 2010), 28 evaluations were performed on nine residents. In Phase 3 (October 2010 to January 2012), 44 evaluations were performed on 13 residents. Total scores improved significantly between Phases 1 and 2 (p = 0.003) and remained elevated throughout Phase 3. When analyzing performance by competency, significant improvement between Phases 1 and 2 (p < 0.05) was seen in all competencies (patient care, knowledge, system-based practice, practice-based learning) with the exception of "communication and professionalism" (p = 0.56). Statistically similar scores were observed between Phases 2 and 3 in all competencies with the exception of "medical knowledge," which showed ongoing significant improvement (p = 0.003)., CONCLUSIONS: Directed resident feedback sessions utilizing data from a real-time, competency-based evaluation tool have allowed us to improve our residents' abilities to lead trauma resuscitations over a 30-month period. Given pressures to maximize clinical educational opportunities among work-hour constraints, such a model may help decrease the need for costly simulation-based training., LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic study, level III.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The advancement of surgical science relies on educating new generations of surgeon-scientists. Career development awards (K Awards) from the National Institutes of Health, often considered a marker of early academic success, are one way physician-scientists may foster skills through a mentored research experience. This study aimed to develop a conceptual framework to understand institutional support and other factors leading to a K Award., METHODS: A national, qualitative study was conducted with academic surgeons. Participants included 15 K Awardees and 12 surgery department Chairs. Purposive sampling ensured a diverse range of experiences. Semistructured, in-depth telephone interviews were conducted. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim, and 2 reviewers analyzed the transcripts using Grounded Theory methodology., RESULTS: Participants described individual and institutional factors contributing to success. K Awardees cited personal factors such as perseverance and team leadership skills. Chairs described the K Awardee as an institutional "investment" requiring protected time for research, financial support, and mentorship. Both K Awardees and Chairs identified a number of challenges unique to the surgeon-scientist, including financial strains and competing clinical demands., CONCLUSION: Institutional support for surgeons pursuing K Awards is a complex investment with significant initial costs to the department. Chairs act as stewards of institutional resources and support those surgeon-scientists most likely to be successful. Although the K Award pathway is one way to develop surgeon-scientists, financial burdens and challenges may limit its usefulness. These findings, however, may better prepare young surgeons to develop career plans and identify new mechanisms for academic productivity.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - BACKGROUND: In a dynamic health care system, strong leadership has never been more important for surgeons. Little is known about how to design and conduct effectively a leadership program specifically for surgeons. We sought to evaluate critically a Leadership Development Program for practicing surgeons by exploring how the program's strengths and weaknesses affected the surgeons' development as physician-leaders., METHODS: At a large academic institution, we conducted semistructured interviews with 21 surgical faculty members who applied voluntarily, were selected, and completed a newly created Leadership Development Program in December 2012. Interview transcripts underwent qualitative descriptive analysis with thematic coding based on grounded theory. Themes were extracted regarding surgeons' evaluations of the program on their development as physician-leaders., RESULTS: After completing the program, surgeons reported personal improvements in the following 4 areas: self-empowerment to lead, self-awareness, team-building skills, and knowledge in business and leadership. Surgeons felt "more confident about stepping up as a leader" and more aware of "how others view me and my interactions." They described a stronger grasp on "giving feedback" as well as a better understanding of "business/organizational issues." Overall, surgeon-participants reported positive impacts of the program on their day-to-day work activities and general career perspective as well as on their long-term career development plans. Surgeons also recommended areas where the program could potentially be improved., CONCLUSION: These interviews detailed self-reported improvements in leadership knowledge and capabilities for practicing surgeons who completed a Leadership Development Program. A curriculum designed specifically for surgeons may enable future programs to equip surgeons better for important leadership roles in a complex health care environment.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Multi-source evaluation has demonstrated value for trainees, but is not generally provided to residency or fellowship program directors (PDs)., OBJECTIVE: To develop, implement, and evaluate a PD multi-source evaluation process., METHODS: Tools were developed for PD evaluation by trainees, department chairs, and graduate medical education (GME) leadership. Evaluation questions were based on PD responsibilities, including Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) requirements. A follow-up survey assessed the process., RESULTS: Evaluation completion rates were as follows: trainees in academic year 2012-2013, 53% (958 of 1824), and in academic year 2013-2014, 42% (800 of 1898); GME directors in 2013-2014, 100% (95 of 95); and chairs/chiefs in 2013-2014, 92% (109 of 118). Results of a follow-up survey of PDs (66%, 59 of 90) and chairs (74%, 48 of 65) supports the evaluations' value, with 45% of responding PDs (25 of 56) and 50% of responding chairs (21 of 42) characterizing them as "extremely" or "quite" useful. Most indicated this was the first written evaluation they had received (PDs 78%, 46 of 59) or provided (chairs 69%, 33 of 48) regarding the PD role. More than 60% of PD (30 of 49) and chair respondents (24 of 40) indicated trainee feedback was "extremely" or "quite" useful, and nearly 50% of PDs (29 of 59) and 21% of chairs (10 of 48) planned changes based on the results. Trainee response rates improved in 2014-2015 (52%, 971 of 1872) and 2015-2016 (69%, 1276 of 1837)., CONCLUSIONS: In our institution, multi-source evaluation of PDs was sustained over 4 years with acceptable and improving evaluation completion rates. The process and assessment tools are potentially transferrable to other institutions.

Y1  - 2016//
N2  - BACKGROUND : Developing effective leadership skills in physicians is critical for safe patient care. Few residency-based models of leadership training exist., OBJECTIVE : We evaluated residents' readiness to engage in leadership training, feasibility of implementing training for all residents, and residents' acceptance of training., METHODS : In its fourth year, the Leadership Development Program (LDP) consists of twelve 90-minute modules (eg, Team Decision Making and Bias, Leadership Styles, Authentic Leadership) targeting all categorical postgraduate year (PGY) 1 residents. Modules are taught during regularly scheduled educational time. Focus group surveys and discussions, as well as annual surveys of PGY-1s assessed residents' readiness to engage in training. LDP feasibility was assessed by considering sustainability of program structures and faculty retention, and resident acceptance of training was assessed by measuring attendance, with the attendance goal of 8 of 12 modules., RESULTS : Residents thought leadership training would be valuable if content remained applicable to daily work, and PGY-1 residents expressed high levels of interest in training. The LDP is part of the core educational programming for PGY-1 residents. Except for 2 modules, faculty presenters have remained consistent. During academic year 2014-2015, 45% (13 of 29) of categorical residents participated in at least 8 of 12 modules, and 72% (21 of 29) participated in at least 7 of 12. To date, 125 categorical residents have participated in training., CONCLUSIONS : Residents appeared ready to engage in leadership training, and the LDP was feasible to implement. The attendance goal was not met, but attendance was sufficient to justify program continuation.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The physician manager role in the health care system is invaluable as they serve as role models and quality setters. The requirements from physician managers have become more demanding and the role less prestigious; yet burnout and its prevention in this group have received little attention. Physician leadership development programmes have generally dealt directly with skill and knowledge acquisition. The aim of this research was to evaluate an intensive workshop designed to modify attitudes and improve skills of physician-managers of community clinics, through focus on personal well-being and empowerment., METHODS: Two hundred fifty six physicians affiliated with Clalit Health Services, the largest health maintenance organization in Israel, participated in 16 IMPACT courses during the years 2013-2015. The programme comprised five full days during a two-week period, including an overnight and follow-up meetings three and six weeks later. Theoretical knowledge, experiential learning, practical tools, deep personal exercises, and simulations were conveyed through individual and group work. Topics included: models of self-awareness, outcome thinking, determining a personal and organizational vision, and creating a personal approach to leadership. At the end of each course, and by email at 6 or more months after completion of the course, participants were asked to anonymously respond to closed questions (on a scale of 1-6) and an open question., RESULTS: Mean scores for the contribution of IMPACT to participants' role of physician manager were 5.3 at the end of the course, and 4.7 at 6 or more months later. Mean scores at 6 or more months were 5.0 regarding the contribution of the programme to personal development, 4.4 regarding satisfaction in the role of physician manager, and 4.6 regarding their coping with managerial dilemmas., CONCLUSION: A workshop that focused on personal growth and self-awareness increased physicians' job satisfaction and their sense of managerial capability, coping with managerial dilemmas, and belonging to the organization.

T1  - Leadership and the medical registrar: how can organisations support these unsung heroes?.
A1  - Blake, Tim
A1  - Whallett, Andrew
Y1  - 2016//
N2  - Medical registrars have been described as the 'workhorses' of National Health Service hospitals, being at the interface of acute and chronic health services. They are expected to demonstrate effective leadership skills. There are concerns from the Royal College of Physicians that medical registrars are being overwhelmed and unsupported by organisations, and are struggling in their ability to provide safe, high-quality patient care. Junior colleagues are also being deterred by general medical specialties by the prospect of becoming the 'Med Reg'. There is a growing need to support medical registrars in several key aspects of training, not least medical leadership. Thus far, there has been a distinct disparity in the provision of medical leadership training for junior doctors in the UK that has adversely affected the standard of care given to patients. Recent landmark reviews and initiatives, principally the Medical Leadership Competency Framework, have raised awareness of leadership competencies for all doctors and the need for their incorporation into undergraduate and postgraduate curricula. It is hoped that interactive strategies to engage medical registrars in leadership training will lead to positive results including improvements in interdisciplinary communication, patient outcomes and fulfilment of curriculum competencies. Organisations have a duty to improve the quality of medical leadership training so that doctors feel equipped to influence change throughout their careers and be tomorrow's leaders. This review outlines the deficiencies in training, the importance of developing leadership skills in medical registrars and educational strategies that could be implemented by organisations in a cost-effective manner.Copyright Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

N2  - BACKGROUND: There have been many efforts to increase the number of women surgeons. We provide an update of women surgeon representation along the pathway to surgical academia., METHODS: Data was extracted from Association of American Medical Colleges FACTS and Faculty Administrative Management Online User System as well as GME annual reports starting in 1994 until the last year available for each., RESULTS: The proportion of graduating women medical students has increased on average .5% per year from 1994 to 2014. Women general surgery trainees have more than doubled in number over the same period but represented 38.3% of all general surgery trainees in 2014. Women Full Professors increased on average .3% from 1994 to 2015 but still make up less than 10% of all Full Professors., CONCLUSIONS: Despite improvements over the past 20 years, there are still large gender gaps in surgery for trainees and academic leadership. At the current rate of increase, women Full Professors will not achieve gender parity until in 2136.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Y1  - 2016//
N2  - OBJECTIVES: The Community Pharmacy Residency Program (CPRP) Planning Committee convened to develop a vision and a strategic action plan for the advancement of community pharmacy residency training. Aligned with the profession's efforts to achieve provider status and expand access to care, the Future Vision and Action Plan for Community-based Residency Training will provide guidance, direction, and a strategic action plan for community-based residency training to ensure that the future needs of community-based pharmacist practitioners are met., DATA SOURCES: National thought leaders, selected because of their leadership in pharmacy practice, academia, and residency training, served on the planning committee. The committee conducted a series of conference calls and an in-person strategic planning meeting held on January 13-14, 2015. Outcomes from the discussions were supplemented with related information from the literature. Results of a survey of CPRP directors and preceptors also informed the planning process., SUMMARY: The vision and strategic action plan for community-based residency training is intended to advance training to meet the emerging needs of patients in communities that are served by the pharmacy profession. The group anticipated the advanced skills required of pharmacists serving as community-based pharmacist practitioners and the likely education, training and competencies required by future residency graduates in order to deliver these services. The vision reflects a transformation of community residency training, from CPRPs to community-based residency training, and embodies the concept that residency training should be primarily focused on training the individual pharmacist practitioner based on the needs of patients served within the community, and not on the physical location where pharmacy services are provided., CONCLUSION: The development of a vision statement, core values statements, and strategic action plan will provide support, guidance, and direction to the profession of pharmacy to continue the advancement and expansion of community-based residency training.Copyright Published by Elsevier Inc.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Research from outside the medical field shows that leadership behaviours influence job satisfaction. Whether the same is true for the medical training setting needs to be explored. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of residents' overall appreciation of their supervisor's leadership and observation of specific supervisor leadership behaviours on job satisfaction., METHODS: We invited residents (N=117) to rate how often they observed certain task and relation-oriented leadership behaviours in their supervisor and overall appreciation of their supervisor's leadership. Furthermore, they rated their satisfaction with 13 different aspects of their jobs on a 10-point scale. Using exploratory factor analysis we identified four factors covering different types of job satisfaction aspects: personal growth, autonomy, affective, and instrumental job satisfaction aspects. Influence of overall appreciation for supervisor leadership and observation of certain leadership behaviours on these job satisfaction factors were analysed using multiple regression analyses., RESULTS: The affective aspects of job satisfaction were positively influenced by overall appreciation of leadership (B=0.792, p=0.017), observation of specific instructions (B=0.972, p=0.008) and two-way communication (B=1.376, p=0.008) and negatively by mutual decision-making (B=-1.285, p=0.007). No effects were found for the other three factors of job satisfaction., CONCLUSIONS: We recommend that supervisors become more aware of whether and how their behaviours influence residents' job satisfaction. Especially providing specific instructions and using two-way communication seem important to help residents deal with their insecurities and to offer them support.

Y1  - 2016//
N2  - Recent efforts to expand medical training in resource-constrained settings are laudable, but change that transforms health systems will require new educational approaches. Today's physician-leaders need to leverage clinical and global health knowledge with a nuanced understanding of the social forces that impact health, the ability to marshal political will, and the capacity to manage dynamic programs and institutions. In establishing the University of Global Health Equity, we have identified three reform principles. First, equipping medical schools with the tools and technology to deliver is imperative. Second, the mismatch between the skills taught in most medical schools and those needed to improve fragile health systems must be addressed. Finally, medical schools that strive to eliminate health inequities should "walk the walk," adopting progressive practices to institutionalize equity. Copyright © 2016 American Medical Association.

N2  - PROBLEM ADDRESSED: To address barriers challenging the engagement of rural and remote family physicians (RRFPs) in research, Memorial University of Newfoundland in St John's has developed a longitudinal faculty development program (FDP) called 6for6., OBJECTIVE OF PROGRAM: To establish and evaluate a longitudinal FDP that promotes a foundation of research activity. Program description Informed by a needs assessment in phase 1, phase 2 saw the 6for6 curriculum designed, developed, and implemented to reflect the unique needs of RRFPs. Preliminary evaluations have been conducted and results will be presented after year 1 of the program., CONCLUSION: The 6for6 FDP has been positively received by participants, and it is evident that they will serve as champions of rural research capacity building. It is anticipated that by April 2017, 18 RRFPs will be equipped with the research and leadership skills required to foster research networks within and outside their communities.

Y1  - 2016//
N2  - BACKGROUND: Up to 60% of practicing physicians report symptoms of burnout, which often peak during residency. Residency is also a relevant time for habits of self-care and resiliency to be emphasized. A growing literature underscores the importance of this; however, evidence about effective burnout prevention curriculum during residency remains limited., OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this project is to evaluate the impact of a new, 1-month wellness curriculum for 12 second-year family medicine residents on burnout, empathy, stress, and self-compassion., METHODS: The pilot program, introduced during a new rotation emphasizing competencies around leadership, focused on teaching skills to cultivate mindfulness and self-compassion in order to enhance empathy and reduce stress. Pre-assessments and 3-month follow-up assessments on measures of burnout, empathy, self-compassion, and perceived stress were collected to evaluate the impact of the curriculum. It was hypothesized that this curriculum would enhance empathy and self-compassion as well as reduce stress and burnout among family medicine residents., RESULTS: Descriptive statistics revealed positive trends on the mean scores of all the measures, particularly the Mindfulness Scale of the Self-Compassion Inventory and the Jefferson Empathy Scale. However, the small sample size and lack of sufficient power to detect meaningful differences limited the use of inferential statistics., CONCLUSIONS: This feasibility study demonstrates how a residency wellness curriculum can be developed, implemented, and evaluated with promising results, including high participant satisfaction.

Y1  - 2016//
N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) has recognized the importance of quality improvement (QI) training and requires that accredited residencies in all specialties demonstrate that residents are "integrated and actively participate in interdisciplinary clinical quality improvement and patient safety activities." However, competing demands in residency training may make this difficult to accomplish. The study's objective is to develop and evaluate a longitudinal curriculum that meets the ACGME requirement for QI and patient safety training and links to patient-centered medical home (PCMH) practices., METHODS: Residents in the Worcester Family Medicine Residency (WFMR) participated in a faculty-developed quality improvement curriculum that included web-based tutorials, quality improvement projects, and small-group sessions across all 3 years of residency. They completed self-evaluations of knowledge and use of curricular activities annually and at graduation, and comparisons were made between two graduating classes, as well as comparison of end of PGY2 to end of PGY3 for one class., RESULTS: Graduating residents who completed the full 3 years of the curriculum rated themselves as significantly more skilled in nine of 15 areas assessed at end of residency compared to after PGY2 and reported confidence in providing future leadership in a focus group. Five areas were also rated significantly higher than prior-year residents., CONCLUSIONS: Involving family medicine residents in a longitudinal curriculum with hands-on practice in implementing QI, patient safety, and chronic illness management activities that are inclusive of PCMH goals increased their self-perceived skills and leadership ability to implement these new and emerging evidence-based practices in primary care.

T1  - Untangling approaches to management and leadership across systems of medical education.
A1  - Hartley, Kathy
Y1  - 2016//
N2  - AIMS: How future doctors might be educated and trained in order to meet the population and system needs of countries is currently being debated. Incorporation of a broad range of capabilities, encompassed within categories of management and, increasingly, leadership, form part of this discussion. The purpose of this paper is to outline a framework by which countries' progress in this area might be assessed and compared., METHODS: Key databases and journals related to this area were reviewed. From relevant articles potential factors impacting on the incorporation of aspects of management and leadership within medical education and training were identified. These factors were tested via an online survey during 2013 with six members of a European Association of doctors who promote medical involvement in hospital management, including members from countries less represented in the health management literature., RESULTS: A framework for analysing how management and leadership education is being approached within different systems of healthcare is developed and presented., CONCLUSIONS: More systematic work across a wider range of countries is needed if we are to have a better understanding of how countries within and beyond Europe are approaching and progressing the education of doctors in management and leadership.

T1  - Why July Matters.

Y1  - 2016//
N2  - Each July, new graduates from premedical, medical, and residency programs, along with junior and midcareer faculty, acclimatize to their changing roles. During this month, overall efficiency, quality, and patient safety may suffer, a problem dubbed the "July effect." The many transitions that occur in teaching hospitals during July are often implicated as the root cause of this problem. The question, then, of how best to improve the team-based clinical care provided in July remains important. In this Commentary, the authors outline a model that combines the team-based care paradigm with effective leadership, followership, and communication-based strategies and propose some actionable steps.A key first step to enhancing patient safety in July is improving effective leadership through use of a select group of attendings whose teaching style empowers learners within a framework of close supervision. Second, programmatic efforts to pair these leaders with good followers are needed. Senior residents in July should be selected on their ability to mentor, guide, and support interns. Third, a system of free-flowing, bidirectional communication must be nurtured to ensure optimal outcomes. Adapting strategies from the airlines (e.g., interdisciplinary conferences to discuss optimal patient care approaches; checklists for daily activities such as sign-outs; directed feedback and debriefing techniques emphasizing actionable areas for improvement) is promising and worth studying.Available data suggest that the "July effect" is real. Developing new and exploring existing approaches for allaying this phenomenon are important areas of further investigation.

Y1  - 2016//
N2  - This AMEE Guide provides a framework to guide medical educators engaged in the design and implementation of "Resident as Teacher" programs. The suggested approaches are based on established models of program development: the Program Logic model to guide program design, the Dundee three-circle model to inform a systematic approach to planning educational content and the Kirkpatrick pyramid, which forms the backbone of program evaluation. The Guide provides an overview of Resident as Teacher curricula, their benefits and impact, from existing literature supplemented by insights from the authors' own experiences, all of whom are engaged in teaching initiatives at their own institutions. A conceptual description of the Program Logic model is provided, a model that highlights an outcomes-based curricular design. Examples of activities under each step of this model are described, which would allow educational leaders to structure their own program based on the scope, context, institutional needs and resources available. Emphasis is placed on a modular curricular format to not only enhance the teaching skills of residents, but also enable development of future career educators, scholars and leaders. Application of the Dundee three-circle model is illustrated to allow for a flexible curricular design that can cater to varying levels of educational needs and interests. In addition, practical advice is provided on robust assessment of outcomes, both assessment of participants and program evaluation. Finally, the authors highlight the need for congruence between the formal and hidden curriculum through explicit recognition of the value of teaching by institutions, support for development of teaching programs, encouragement of evidence-based approach to education and rewards for all levels of teachers.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Few new Residency Program Directors (PD) are formally trained for the demands and responsibilities of the leadership aspect of their role. Currently, there are no comprehensive frameworks that describe specific leadership competencies that can inform PD self-reflection or faculty development., METHODS: The authors developed a Postgraduate Program Director Competency Inventory (PPDCI) in order to frame the performance of PDs for a multisource feedback (MSF) program. The development of the PPDCI occurred in five phases which involved: development of an initial inventory, implementation of a key informant survey of national opinion leaders, execution of a validity survey with postgraduate education leaders and committee members and implementation of a further refined inventory with 17 PD and 147 raters as part of a pilot MSF program., OUTCOMES: Five distinct domains of leadership competence were identified which included: Communication and relationship management, leadership, professionalism and self-management, environmental engagement, and management skills and knowledge. The content validity of the PPDCI was endorsed by 85% of the key informants. The validity survey indicated strong endorsement of the PPDCI domains and recognition of its utility for both orientation of new PD as well as a frame for self-assessment. The pilot MSF program yielded a further refined and reduced inventory of 26 items of competence as well as recommendations for its utility., CONCLUSIONS: Use of this leadership inventory has the potential to ensure effective leadership of postgraduate programs.

N2  - PURPOSE: Certain pressures stemming from within the medical community and from society in general, such as the need for increased accountability in resident training and restricted resident duty hours, have prompted a re-examination of methods for training physicians. Leaders in medical education in North America and around the world champion competency-based medical education (CBME) as a solution. The Department of Anesthesiology at the University of Ottawa launched Canada's first CBME program for anesthesiology residents on July 1, 2015. In this paper, we discuss the opportunities and challenges associated with CBME and delineate the elements of the new CBME program at the University of Ottawa., SOURCE: Review of the current literature., PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Competency-based medical education addresses some of the challenges associated with physician training, such as ensuring that specialists are competent in all key areas and reducing training costs. In principle, competency-based medical education can better meet the needs of patients, providers, and other stakeholders in the healthcare system, but its success will depend on support from all involved. As CBME is implemented, anesthesiologists have the opportunity to become leaders in innovation and medical education. The University of Ottawa has implemented a CBME program with a twofold purpose, namely, to focus learning opportunities on the development of the specific competencies required of practicing anesthesiologists and to test the effectiveness of a reduction in the length of training., CONCLUSION: Canadian anesthesia residency programs will soon transition to CBME in order to promote better transparency, accountability, fairness, fiscal responsibility, and patient safety. Competency-based medical education offers significant potential advantages for healthcare stakeholders.

Y1  - 2016//
N2  - Nurse residency programs have been adopted by health care organizations to assist new graduate nurses with daily challenges such as intense working environments, increasing patient acuity, and complex technologies. Overall, nurse residency programs are proven beneficial in helping nurses transition from the student role to independent practitioners and bedside leaders. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of residency programs on leadership skills of new Saudi graduate nurses who completed a residency program compared to new Saudi graduate nurses who did not participate in residency programs. The study design was cross-sectional involving a convenience sample (n = 98) of new graduate nurses from three hospitals in Saudi Arabia. The Clinical Leadership Survey was used to measure the new graduate nurses' clinical leadership skills based on whether they completed a residency program or not. Descriptive statistics, correlation, and multiple linear regression analyses were conducted to examine leadership skills in this sample of new Saudi graduate nurses. A significant difference was found between residents and nonresidents in their leadership skills (t = 10.48, P = .000). Specifically, residents were significantly more likely to show higher levels of leadership skills compared to their counterparts. Attending a residency program was associated with a significant increase in clinical leadership skills. The findings of this study indicate that there is a need to implement more residency programs in hospitals of Saudi Arabia. It is imperative that nurse managers and policy makers in Saudi Arabia consider these findings to improve nurses' leadership skills, which will in turn improve patient care. Further research should examine how residency programs influence new graduate nurses' transition from student to practitioner with regard to clinical leadership skills in Saudi Arabia.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Despite a growing demand for skilled clinician-educators, residents today rarely receive formal training in clinical teaching, curriculum development, administration, leadership, or educational scholarship. The authors describe the development, implementation, and preliminary evaluation of the O'Connor Stanford Leaders in Education Residency (OSLER) track, a novel clinician-educator track within the family medicine residency program affiliated with Stanford University School of Medicine., METHODS: In 2010, the OSLER track was introduced at O'Connor Hospital, a community hospital that houses an 8-8-8 family medicine residency program. Residents who are in good standing can apply to the track at the midpoint of their first postgraduate year. Residents are immersed in a flexible, experience-based, 2.5-year-long curriculum with hands-on teaching activities at its core. To foster skills in educational scholarship, track residents are required to design and complete a scholarly project., RESULTS: A comprehensive evaluation plan is currently in progress. Preliminary data indicates high levels of satisfaction with the track's overall value, impact on core teaching skills, and effect on career trajectory. Residents gained more confidence in core teaching skills as they progressed through the track. Scholarly work output by residents has increased significantly since the track was implemented. The residency program has seen an increased interest from applicants since the track was started, with data suggesting that applicant quality has increased from the pre-track to post-track years., CONCLUSIONS: More research is needed to assess the effectiveness and reproducibility of this clinician-educator track. If proven, this model may be replicated at other academic medical centers.

T1  - [Management Competence in Leading Positions in Clinical Surgery - What Does a Surgeon Need to Know?].
T2  - Managementkompetenzen fur Fuhrungspositionen in der klinischen Chirurgie - was muss der Chirurg wissen?
A1  - Hellmann, W
A1  - Meyer, F
Y1  - 2016//
N2  - Background: Surgeons, more than other specialists, are required to combine high medical expertise with management competence. This is due to changing environments, new demands with respect to quality, the ongoing discussion on increased performance in the context of questionable target agreements, an increasing tendency of university hospitals and other departments and clinics to recruit leading personnel in medicine with management competence, but also to the understanding of one's own role and surgeons' distinguished public reputation. Aim: This narrative review describes the changing environments for surgeons in leading positions in hospitals and provides an overview on the practical use of management skills in surgery. In addition, it advises on how to acquire management competence and presents an educational concept appropriate for surgeons in leading positions. Key points: 1. The management of new challenges in the healthcare system - also in clinical surgery - requires management skills, which are indispensable for a surgeon in a leading position. 2. Management skills in surgery comprise aspects such as communication ability, social competence, cooperation and leadership skills, knowledge on business administration aspects and legal certainty. 3. The necessary knowledge can be acquired in courses leading to a certificate (e.g. "MHM Medical Hospital Manager") or by earning a "Master of Business Administration" (MBA). Conclusion: Management competence is essential in leading positions in clinical surgery today. The use of these skills is challenging in daily practice. Successfully applied, management competence not only guarantees comprehensive patient care and leadership of employees, but also provides satisfaction in leading positions of a surgical department.Copyright Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart .

N2  - The CAPE 2013 Outcomes answered the call for increased student leadership development (SLD) by identifying leadership as a desired curricular goal. To meet this outcome, colleges and schools of pharmacy are advised to first identify a set of SLD competencies aligned with their institution's mission and goals and then organize these competencies into a SLD framework/model. Student leadership development should be integrated vertically and horizontally within the curriculum in a deliberate and longitudinal manner. It should include all student pharmacists, begin at the point of admission, and extend beyond extracurricular activities. The school's assessment plan should be aligned with the identified SLD competencies so student learning related to leadership is assessed. To accomplish these recommendations, a positive environment for SLD should be cultivated within the school, including administrative backing and resources, as well as support among the broader faculty for integrating SLD into the curriculum.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: The Enhancing Human Resources and Use of Appropriate Training for Maternal and Perinatal Survival in sub-Saharan Africa (ETATMBA) project is training non-physician clinicians as advanced clinical leaders in emergency maternal and newborn care in Tanzania and Malawi. The main aims of this process evaluation were to explore the implementation of the programme of training in Tanzania, how it was received, how or if the training has been implemented into practice and the challenges faced along the way., DESIGN: Qualitative interviews with trainees, trainers, district officers and others exploring the application of the training into practice., PARTICIPANTS: During late 2010 and 2011, 36 trainees including 19 assistant medical officers one senior clinical officer and 16 nurse midwives/nurses (anaesthesia) were recruited from districts across rural Tanzania and invited to join the ETATMBA training programme., RESULTS: Trainees (n=36) completed the training returning to 17 facilities, two left and one died shortly after training. Of the remaining trainees, 27 were interviewed at their health facility. Training was well received and knowledge and skills were increased. There were a number of challenges faced by trainees, not least that their new skills could not be practised because the facilities they returned to were not upgraded. Nonetheless, there is evidence that the training is having an effect locally on health outcomes, like maternal and neonatal mortality, and the trainees are sharing their new knowledge and skills with others., CONCLUSIONS: The outcome of this evaluation is encouraging but highlights that there are many ongoing challenges relating to infrastructure (including appropriate facilities, electricity and water) and the availability of basic supplies and drugs. This cadre of workers is a dedicated and valuable resource that can make a difference, which with better support could make a greater contribution to healthcare in the country.Copyright Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: During late 2010, 36 trainees including 19 assistant medical officers (AMOs) 1 senior clinical officer (CO) and 16 nurse midwives/nurses were recruited from districts across rural Tanzania and invited to join the Enhancing Human Resources and Use of Appropriate Technologies for Maternal and Perinatal Survival in the sub-Saharan Africa (ETATMBA) training programme. The ETATMBA project was training associate clinicians (ACs) as advanced clinical leaders in emergency obstetric care. The trainees returned to health facilities across the country with the hope of being able to apply their new skills and knowledge. The main aim of this study was to explore the impact of the ETATMBA training on health outcomes including maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality in their facilities. Secondly, to explore the challenges faced in working in these health facilities., DESIGN: The study is a pre-examination/postexamination of maternal and neonatal health indicators and a survey of health facilities in rural Tanzania. The facilities surveyed were those in which ETATMBA trainees were placed post-training. The maternal and neonatal indicators were collected for 2011 and 2013 and the survey of the facilities was in early 2014., RESULTS: 16 of 17 facilities were surveyed. Maternal deaths show a non-significant downward trend over the 2 years (282-232 cases/100,000 live births). There were no significant differences in maternal, neonatal and birth complication variables across the time-points. The survey of facilities revealed shortages in key areas and some are a serious concern., CONCLUSIONS: This study represents a snapshot of rural health facilities providing maternal and neonatal care in Tanzania. Enhancing knowledge, practical skills, and clinical leadership of ACs may have a positive impact on health outcomes. However, any impact may be confounded by the significant challenges in delivering a service in terms of resources. Thus, training may be beneficial, but it requires an infrastructure that supports it.Copyright Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore the views of members of theater teams regarding the proposed introduction of a workplace-based assessment of nontechnical skills of surgeons (NOTSS) into the Intercollegiate Surgical Curriculum Programme in the United Kingdom. In addition, the previous training and familiarity of the members of the surgical theater team with the concept and assessment of NOTSS would be evaluated., DESIGN: A regional survey of members of theater teams (consultant surgeons, anesthetists, scrub nurses, and trainees) was performed at 1 teaching and 2 district general hospitals in South Yorkshire., RESULTS: There were 160 respondents corresponding to a response rate of 81%. The majority (77%) were not aware of the NOTSS assessment tool with only 9% of respondents reporting to have previously used the NOTSS tool and just 3% having received training in NOTSS assessment. Overall, 81% stated that assessing NOTSS was as important as assessing technical skills. Trainees attributed less importance to nontechnical skills than the other groups (p <= 0.016). Although opinion appears divided as to whether the presence of a consultant surgeon in theater could potentially make it difficult to assess a trainee's leadership skills and decision-making capabilities, overall 60% agree that the routine use of NOTSS assessment would enhance safety in the operating theater and 80% agree that the NOTSS tool should be introduced to assess the nontechnical skills of trainees in theater. However, a significantly lower proportion of trainees (45%) agreed on the latter compared with the other groups (p = 0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: Our survey demonstrates acceptability among the theater team for the introduction of the NOTSS tool into the surgical curriculum. However, lack of familiarity highlights the importance of faculty training for assessors before such an introduction.Copyright © 2015 Association of Program Directors in Surgery.

N2  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of this investigation was to evaluate, monitor and manage the quality of projects conducted and work produced as evidence of scholarship upon completion of Doctor of Nursing Practice education., BACKGROUND: The Doctor of Nursing Practice is a relatively new degree which prepares nurses for high impact careers in diverse practice settings around the globe. Considerable variation characterises curricula across schools preparing Doctors of Nursing Practice. Accreditation assures curricula are focused on attainment of the Doctor of Nursing Practice essentials, yet outcomes have not been reported to help educators engage in programme improvement. This work has implications for nursing globally because translating strong evidence into practice is key to improving outcomes in direct care, leadership, management and education. The Doctor of Nursing Practice student learns to accomplish translation through the conduct of projects. Evaluating the rigour and results of these projects is essential to improving the quality, safety and efficacy of translation, improvements in care and overall system performance., DESIGN: A descriptive study was conducted to evaluate the scholarly products of Doctor of Nursing Practice education in one programme across four graduating classes., METHODS: A total of 80 projects, conducted across the USA and around the globe, are described using a modification of the Uncertainty, Pace, Complexity Model., RESULTS: The per cent of students considered to have produced high quality work in relation to target expectations as well as the per cent that conducted means testing increased over the four study years., CONCLUSIONS: Evaluation of scope, complexity and rigour of scholarly work products has driven improvements in the curriculum and informed the work of faculty and advisors., RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Methods, evaluation and outcomes conformed around a set of expectations for scholarship and rigour have resulted in measurable outcomes, and quality publications have increased over time.Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

N2  - PURPOSE: Good leadership is essential for optimal trauma team performance, and targeted training of leadership skills is necessary to achieve such leadership proficiency. To address the need for a taxonomy of leadership skills that specifies the skill components to be learned and the behaviors by which they can be assessed across the five phases of trauma care, the authors developed the Taxonomy of Trauma Leadership Skills (TTLS)., METHOD: Critical incident interviews were conducted with trauma team leaders and members from different specialties-emergency physicians, trauma surgeons, anesthesiologists, and emergency ward nurses-at three teaching hospitals in the Netherlands during January-June 2013. Data were iteratively analyzed for examples of excellent leadership skills at each phase of trauma care. Using the grounded theory approach, elements of excellent leadership skills were identified and classified. Elements and behavioral markers were sorted and categorized using multiple raters. In a two-round verification process in late 2013, the taxonomy was reviewed and rated by trauma team leaders and members from the multiple specialties for its coverage of essential items., RESULTS: Data were gathered from 28 interviews and 14 raters. The TTLS details 5 skill categories (information coordination, decision making, action coordination, communication management, and coaching and team development) and 37 skill elements. The skill elements are captured by 67 behavioral markers. The three-level taxonomy is presented according to five phases of trauma care., CONCLUSIONS: The TTLS provides a framework for teaching, learning, and assessing team leadership skills in trauma care and other complex, acute care situations.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Although numerous leadership development programs (LDPs) exist in health care, no programs have been specifically designed to meet the needs of surgeons. This study aimed to elicit practicing surgeons' motivations and desired goals for leadership training to design an evidence-based LDP in surgery., MATERIALS AND METHODS: At a large academic health center, we conducted semistructured interviews with 24 surgical faculty members who voluntarily applied and were selected for participation in a newly created LDP. Transcriptions of the interviews were analyzed using analyst triangulation and thematic coding to extract major themes regarding surgeons' motivations and perceived needs for leadership knowledge and skills. Themes from interview responses were then used to design the program curriculum specifically to meet the leadership needs of surgical faculty., RESULTS: Three major themes emerged regarding surgeons' motivations for seeking leadership training: (1) Recognizing key gaps in their formal preparation for leadership roles; (2) Exhibiting an appetite for personal self-improvement; and (3) Seeking leadership guidance for career advancement. Participants' interviews revealed four specific domains of knowledge and skills that they indicated as desired takeaways from a LDP: (1) leadership and communication; (2) team building; (3) business acumen/finance; and (4) greater understanding of the health care context., CONCLUSIONS: Interviews with surgical faculty members identified gaps in prior leadership training and demonstrated concrete motivations and specific goals for participating in a formal leadership program. A LDP that is specifically tailored to address the needs of surgical faculty may benefit surgeons at a personal and institutional level.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

T1  - National Survey Regarding the Importance of Leadership in PGY1 Pharmacy Practice Residency Training.

Y1  - 2015//
N2  - BACKGROUND: Leadership is considered a professional obligation for all pharmacists. It is important to integrate leadership training in residency programs to meet the leadership needs and requirements of the profession., OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the importance of leadership development during postgraduate year 1 (PGY1) pharmacy practice residency training as perceived by new practitioners., METHODS: A 15-question online survey was distributed to residency-trained new practitioners to assess (1) amount of time dedicated to leadership training during residency training, (2) different leadership tools utilized, (3) residents' participation in various committees or councils, (4) perceived benefit of increased leadership training, (5) importance of having a mentor, (6) understanding of the residency organization's strategic objectives, (7) discussion of Pharmacy Practice Model Initiative (PPMI) during residency training, and (8) adequacy of leadership training in preparation to become a pharmacy practice leader., RESULTS: Although the majority of resident respondents had less than 20% of their residency devoted to leadership, nearly all survey participants acknowledged that leadership is an important component of PGY1 residency training. Residents agreed that their residency experience would have benefited from increased leadership opportunities. Most residents were knowledgeable about their organization's strategic objectives but did not have a full understanding of pharmacy initiatives such as the PPMI., CONCLUSION: Feedback from residents indicates that an optimal dedication to leadership training would range between 20% and 30% of the residency year. Increased focus on PPMI, mentorship, and expanded use of leadership tools can serve as a way to help meet the future leadership needs of the pharmacy profession and help to better prepare residents to become pharmacy practice leaders.

N2  - Internal medicine (IM) physicians, including residents, assume both formal and informal leadership roles that significantly impact clinical and organizational outcomes. However, most internists lack formal leadership training. In 2013 and 2014, we surveyed all rising second-year IM residents at a large northeastern academic medical center about their need for, and preferences regarding, leadership training. Fifty-five of 113 residents (49%) completed the survey. Forty-four residents (80% of respondents) reported a need for additional formal leadership training. A self-reported need for leadership training was not associated with respondents' gender or previous leadership training and experience. Commonly cited leadership skill needs included "leading a team" (98% of residents), "confronting problem employees" (93%), "coaching and developing others" (93%), and "resolving interpersonal conflict" (84%). Respondents preferred to learn about leadership using multiple teaching modalities. Fifty residents (91%) preferred to have a physician teach them about leadership, while 19 (35%) wanted instruction from a hospital manager. IM residents may not receive adequate leadership development education during pregraduate and postgraduate training. IM residents may be more likely to benefit from leadership training interventions that are physician-led, multimodal, and occur during the second year of residency. These findings can help inform the design of effective leadership development programs for physician trainees.

N2  - PURPOSE: Medical school graduates are poorly prepared to address health care inequities found in urban, underserved communities. The University of Illinois College of Medicine developed the Urban Medicine Program (UMed) to prepare students for the roles of advocate, researcher, policy maker, and culturally competent practitioner through a four-year curriculum integrating principles of public health with direct interventions in local, underserved communities. This study assessed the program's effectiveness and evaluated early outcomes., METHOD: The authors analyzed data for UMed students (graduating classes 2009-2013) from pre- and postseminar assessments and longitudinal community project progress reports. They also compared UMed and non-UMed outcomes from the same classes, using graduation data and data from two surveys: Medical Students' Attitudes Toward the Underserved (MSATU) and the Intercultural/Professional Assessment., RESULTS: UMed students were more likely than non-UMed students to endorse MSATU constructs ("Universal medical care is a right" [P = .01], "Access to basic medical care is a right" [P = .03], "Access is influenced by social determinants" [P = .03]); to be selected for the Gold Humanism Honor Society (P < .0001); to complete joint degrees (P < .0001); and to enter primary care residencies (P = .002)., CONCLUSIONS: Early outcomes reveal that a longitudinal, experiential curriculum can provide students with competencies that may prepare them for leadership roles in advocacy, research, and policy making. Contact with diverse communities inculcates-in medical students with predispositions toward helping underserved populations-the self-efficacy and skills to positively influence underserved, urban communities.

N2  - Strategic planning and thinking skills are essential for today's nurse leaders. Doctor of nursing practice (DNP) programs provide an opportunity for developing effective nurse strategists. A well-designed strategy course can stimulate intellectual growth at all levels of Bloom's Taxonomy. Discussion forums in online education provide new opportunities for rich interaction among peers en route to development of well-informed strategic plans. An interprofessional perspective adds a rich and vital aspect to doctoral nursing education and it serves to inform strategic plan development. A roadmap for teaching strategic planning to current and future nursing leaders will guide the integration of essential content into DNP programs.

Y1  - 2015//
N2  - CONTEXT: As doctors in all specialties are expected to undertake leadership within health care organisations, leadership development has become an inherent part of medical education. Whereas the leadership literature within medical education remains mostly focused on individual, hierarchical leadership, contemporary theory posits leadership as a group process, which should be distributed across all levels of health care organisation. This gap between theory and practice indicates that there is a need to understand what leadership and followership mean to medical trainees working in today's interprofessional health care workplace., METHODS: Epistemologically grounded in social constructionism, this research involved 19 individual and 11 group interviews with 65 UK medical trainees across all stages of training and a range of specialties. Semi-structured interviewing techniques were employed to capture medical trainees' conceptualisations of leadership and followership. Interviews were audiotaped, transcribed verbatim and analysed using thematic framework analysis to identify leadership and followership dimensions which were subsequently mapped onto leadership discourses found in the literature., RESULTS: Although diversity existed in terms of medical trainees' understandings of leadership and followership, unsophisticated conceptualisations focusing on individual behaviours, hierarchy and personality were commonplace in trainees' understandings. This indicated the dominance of an individualist discourse. Patterns in understandings across all stages of training and specialties, and whether definitions were solicited or unsolicited, illustrated that context heavily influenced trainees' conceptualisations of leadership and followership., CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that UK trainees typically hold traditional understandings of leadership and followership, which are clearly influenced by the organisational structures in which they work. Although education may change these understandings to some extent, changes in leadership practices to reflect contemporary theory are unlikely to be sustained if leadership experiences in the workplace continue to be based on individualist models.Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Due to a limited health workforce, many health care providers in Africa must take on health leadership roles with minimal formal training in leadership. Hence, the need to equip health care providers with practical skills required to lead high-impact health care programs. In Uganda, the Afya Bora Global Health Leadership Fellowship is implemented through the Makerere University College of Health Sciences (MakCHS) and her partner institutions. Lessons learned from the program, presented in this paper, may guide development of in-service training opportunities to enhance leadership skills of health workers in resource-limited settings., METHODS: The Afya Bora Consortium, a consortium of four African and four U.S. academic institutions, offers 1-year global health leadership-training opportunities for nurses and doctors. Applications are received and vetted internationally by members of the consortium institutions in Botswana, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and the USA. Fellows have 3 months of didactic modules and 9 months of mentored field attachment with 80% time dedicated to fellowship activities. Fellows' projects and experiences, documented during weekly mentor-fellow meetings and monthly mentoring team meetings, were compiled and analyzed manually using pre-determined themes to assess the effect of the program on fellows' daily leadership opportunities., RESULTS: Between January 2011 and January 2015, 15 Ugandan fellows (nine doctors and six nurses) participated in the program. Each fellow received 8 weeks of didactic modules held at one of the African partner institutions and three online modules to enhance fellows' foundation in leadership, communication, monitoring and evaluation, health informatics, research methodology, grant writing, implementation science, and responsible conduct of research. In addition, fellows embarked on innovative projects that covered a wide spectrum of global health challenges including critical analysis of policy formulation and review processes, bottlenecks in implementation of national HIV early infant diagnosis and prevention of mother-to-child HIV-transmission programs, and use of routine laboratory data about antibiotic resistance to guide updates of essential drug lists., CONCLUSION: In-service leadership training was feasible, with ensured protected time for fellows to generate evidence-based solutions to challenges within their work environment. With structured mentorship, collaborative activities at academic institutions and local health care programs equipped health care providers with leadership skills.

Y1  - 2015//
N2  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this paper is to present a case study which details the successful development, design and deployment of a leadership course for academic medical department chairs. The course provides a needed local and contextual alternative to the lengthy and often theoretical MBA/MHA., DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: Faculty developers used a multi-tiered methodology for developing the physician leadership course. The methodology consisted of literature findings, needs assessment, stakeholder input and structured interviews with administrative leaders., FINDINGS: The research, stakeholder input and interviews revealed an increasing number of physician leaders with a general lack of fundamental administrative leadership skills. These shortfalls are largely because of underexposure to core management competencies during medical school and limited contextual knowledge outside their organization. There is an urgent need for leadership development opportunities aimed at current and future academic medical department chairs., RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS: This research is limited by the assumptions that the curriculum meets the ever-changing needs of health-care leaders, the course's focus on academic medical department chairs within the Texas Medical Center and the lack of long range follow-up data to substantiate the effectiveness of the curriculum content and course structure., PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: The Academic Medical Department Leadership course offers valuable management skills training which complements standard medical training. Much of the course structure and content is adaptable to physician administrative and leadership positions in all settings., ORIGINALITY/VALUE: Although the Academic Medical Department Leadership course is a response to a local concern, the study offers a generalizable approach to addressing the demand for skilled physician leaders.

Y1  - 2015//
N2  - To confront the challenges facing modern health care, experts and organizations are calling for an increase in physician leadership capabilities. In response to this need, physician leadership programs are proliferating, targeting all levels of experience at all levels of training. Many academic medical centers, major universities, and specialty societies now sponsor physician leadership training programs. To meet this need, The Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University, as part of its Primary Care-Population Medicine (PC-PM) Program, designed a four-year integrated curriculum, Leadership in Health Care, to engage with leadership topics starting early in the preclinical stages of training. This paper describes the design and implementation of this leadership curriculum for PC-PM students.

Y1  - 2015//
N2  - BACKGROUND: Preventable harm is one of the top six health problems in the developed world. Developing patient safety skills and knowledge among advanced trainee doctors is critical. Clinical supervision is the main form of training for advanced trainees. The use of supervision to develop patient safety competence has not been established., OBJECTIVE: To establish the use of clinical supervision and other workplace training to develop non-technical patient safety competency in advanced trainee doctors., DATA SOURCES: Keywords, synonyms and subject headings were used to search eight electronic databases in addition to hand-searching of relevant journals up to 1 March 2014., METHOD: Titles and abstracts of retrieved publications were screened by two reviewers and checked by a third. Full-text articles were screened against the eligibility criteria. Data on design, methods and key findings were extracted. Clinical supervision documents were assessed against components common to established patient safety frameworks. Findings from the reviewed articles and document analysis were collated in a narrative synthesis., RESULTS: Clinical supervision is not identified as an avenue for embedding patient safety skills in the workplace and is consequently not evaluated as a method to teach trainees these skills. Workplace training in non-technical patient safety skills is limited, but one-off training courses are sometimes used., CONCLUSIONS: Clinical supervision is the primary avenue for learning in postgraduate medical education but the most overlooked in the context of patient safety learning. The widespread implementation of short courses is not matched by evidence of rigorous evaluation. Supporting supervisors to identify teaching moments during supervision and to give weight to non-technical skills and technical skills equally is critical.Copyright Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

N2  - BACKGROUND: In recent years, physician groups, government agencies and third party payers in the United States of America have promoted a Patient-centered Medical Home (PCMH) model that fosters a team-based approach to primary care. Advocates highlight the model's collaborative approach where physicians, mid-level providers, nurses and other health care personnel coordinate their efforts with an aim for high-quality, efficient care. Early studies show improvement in quality measures, reduction in emergency room visits and cost savings. However, implementing the PCMH presents particular challenges to physician training programs, including institutional commitment, infrastructure expenditures and faculty training., DISCUSSION: Teaching programs must consider how the objectives of the PCMH model align with recent innovations in resident evaluation now required by the Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) in the US. This article addresses these challenges, assesses the preliminary success of a pilot project, and proposes a viable, realistic model for implementation at other institutions.

N2  - BACKGROUND: New skills are needed to properly prepare the next generation of physicians and health professionals to practice in medical homes. Transforming residency training to address these new skills requires strong leadership., OBJECTIVE: We sought to increase the understanding of leadership skills useful in residency programs that plan to undertake meaningful change., METHODS: The Preparing the Personal Physician for Practice (P4) project (2007-2014) was a comparative case study of 14 family medicine residencies that engaged in innovative training redesign, including altering the scope, content, sequence, length, and location of training to align resident education with requirements of the patient-centered medical home. In 2012, each P4 residency team submitted a final summary report of innovations implemented, overall insights, and dissemination activities during the study. Six investigators conducted independent narrative analyses of these reports. A consensus meeting held in September 2012 was used to identify key leadership actions associated with successful educational redesign., RESULTS: Five leadership actions were associated with successful implementation of innovations and residency transformation: (1) manage change; (2) develop financial acumen; (3) adapt best evidence educational strategies to the local environment; (4) create and sustain a vision that engages stakeholders; and (5) demonstrate courage and resilience., CONCLUSIONS: Residency programs are expected to change to better prepare their graduates for a changing delivery system. Insights about effective leadership skills can provide guidance for faculty to develop the skills needed to face practical realities while guiding transformation.

N2  - Although the presence of physicians in formal leadership positions has often been limited to roles of department chiefs, MAC chairs, etc., a growing number of organizations are recruiting physicians to other leadership positions (e.g., VP, CEO) where their involvement is being genuinely sought and valued. While physicians have traditionally risen to leadership positions based on clinical excellence or on a rotational basis, truly effective physician leadership that includes competencies such as strategic planning, budgeting, mentoring, network development, etc., is essential to support organizational goals, improve performance and overall efficiency as well as ensuring the quality of care. In this context, the authors have developed a physician leader development and succession planning matrix and supporting toolkit to assist hospitals in identifying and nurturing the next generation of physician leaders.

T1  - Are psychiatrists trained to be leaders in mental health? A survey of early career psychiatrists.
A1  - van Zeist-Jongman, Annette
Y1  - 2015//
N2  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate how early career psychiatrists in 2014 valued the leadership skill education in their training to become psychiatrists., METHOD: All psychiatrists who gained Fellowship since 2009 after training in New Zealand or Australia were invited to take part in a survey., RESULTS: Respondents considered themselves not adequately prepared for the leadership, management and administrative tasks and roles they have as psychiatrists, with preparedness for management tasks scoring the lowest. They valued as most useful to have opportunity to practice with a leadership role, to be able to observe 'leaders at work', to have a supervisor with special interests and skills in leadership and management and to have a formal teaching program on leadership and management. They advised teaching to be given throughout the entire 5 years of the training program by experienced leaders., CONCLUSIONS: Leadership skills training in the education of psychiatrists should contain both practical experience with leadership and management roles and formal teaching sessions on leadership and management skills development. Suggestions for improvement of the leadership and management skills education in the training of psychiatrists have been formulated.Copyright © The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists 2015.

N2  - In today's fast-paced, data-saturated, zero-tolerance practice environment, psychiatrists and other health care providers are expected to maintain clinical, fiscal, and administrative competence. The authors present a unique type of psychiatric leader-the leader-teacher-who incorporates teaching of these elements into day-to-day practice, enhancing lifelong learning for credentialed staff and increasing their confidence in managing complex clinical and administrative issues. Particular emphasis is placed on leader-teachers working in military environments. The article discusses the primary characteristics of this type of leader, including their tendency to (1) seek clarification, (2) distill information, (3) communicate guidance, and (4) catalogue products. The authors also address the advantages and disadvantages of being a leader-teacher and present several illustrative cases.

A1  - Saeed, Sy Atezaz
Y1  - 2015//
N2  - In the changing landscape of healthcare the number of psychiatrists entering leadership positions has declined steadily over the years. One factor contributing to this appears to be lack of leadership training during residency training. International competency frameworks have addressed this and some programs, both national and international, have designed innovative curricula to provide didactic and experiential learning in administration during and after residency. Despite guidelines by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education regarding competency in administrative aspects of health care delivery, most psychiatrists feel ill-equipped to assume a leadership position after residency training. Inculcating comprehensive administrative training into residency faces many challenges related to funding and saturation of existing curricula. Administrative training should be a mandatory element in the training of all residents irrespective of the setting in which they intend to practice. Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education should consider taking a prescriptive approach in shaping competency frameworks to address the need for residents to be fluent in administrative aspects of practice. Training psychiatrist-administrators will be crucial in the future of mental health-care, both from the perspective of consumers as well as psychiatry as a specialty.

Y1  - 2015//
N2  - BACKGROUND: Clinical leadership is considered essential for maintaining and improving patient care and safety in the UK, and is incorporated in the curriculum for all trainee doctors., CONTEXT: Despite the growing focus on the importance of leadership, and the introduction of the Medical Leadership Competency Framework (MLCF) in the UK, leadership education for doctors in training is still in its infancy. Assessment is focused on clinical skills, and trainee doctors receive very little formal feedback on their leadership competencies., INNOVATION: In this article we describe the approach taken by Health Education Kent, Sussex and Surrey (HEKSS) to raise the profile of leadership amongst doctors in training in the South Thames Foundation School (STFS). An annual structured formative assessment in leadership for each trainee has been introduced, supported by leadership education for both trainees and their supervisors in HEKSS trusts. We analysed over 500 of these assessments from the academic year 2012/13 for foundation doctors in HEKSS trusts, in order to assess the quality of the feedback. From the analysis, potential indicators of more effective formative assessments were identified. These may be helpful in improving the leadership education programme for future years., IMPLICATIONS: There is a wealth of evidence to highlight the importance and value of formative assessments; however, particularly for foundation doctors, these have typically been focused on assessing clinical capabilities. This HEKSS initiative encourages doctors to recognise leadership opportunities at the beginning of their careers, seeks to help them understand the importance of acquiring leadership skills and provides structured feedback to help them improve. Leadership education for doctors in training is still in its infancy.Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Y1  - 2015//
N2  - The Workshop for New Leaders represents an innovative project undertaken by the midwifery faculty at a teaching hospital in New England. The midwifery faculty sought to expand their educational offerings to the obstetrics and gynecology residents. Utilizing creative thinking strategies, the idea for a leadership workshop was originated in an effort to augment the professionalism curriculum mandated by the Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education for residents. Over time, this workshop has become a highlight for each class. Not only has this workshop facilitated transition from learner to leader as the residents approach their final year of training, it has also helped to enhance interprofessional relationships. This article is part of a special series of articles that address midwifery innovations in clinical practice, education, interprofessional collaboration, health policy, and global health.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The modern medical world is dynamic and boundless. There is a need for the medical training system currently existing in Israel to undergo a thorough conceptual change in order to strive for excellence and innovation on the one hand and to prevent the "brain drain" from Israel on the other., OBJECTIVE: To report on the "Talpiot" program at the "Sheba Medical Center", which identifies, promotes and prepares the most talented young doctors to fill key positions in the fields of medicine and health in Israel., METHODS: This study is based on a project with the same name in the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF). It promotes an elite group of physicians and researchers at the medical center and includes the provision of scholarships, personal guidance and customized educational opportunities for its members. Conversely, every member in the program is committed to complete five years of training followed by another five years as a senior physician or a researcher at the medical center., RESULTS: Since 2002, there have been six cycles of "Talpionaires". The current 46 members of the program fill key leadership roles in the medical center and are considered leaders in their field. Among the program's alumni are managers of institutes, units and research institutes. This group is responsible for the publication of hundreds of scientific papers studies and dozens of patents in medical technology. Some of them have progressed academically far beyond their peers., CONCLUSIONS: Excellence programs are an integral part of any institution which considers itself a leader, both in medicine and beyond. The exciting and visionary "Talpiot" program is Sheba's contribution to the quality of the medical system in the country of Israel in the long run. Promoting young doctors and researchers to become leaders in the Israeli medical system is an integral part of national interests.

N2  - PROBLEM: The scope and scale of developments in health care redesign have not been sufficiently adopted in primary care residency programs., APPROACH: The interdisciplinary Primary Care Faculty Development Initiative was created to teach faculty how to accelerate revisions in primary care residency training. The program focused on skill development in teamwork, change management, leadership, population management, clinical microsystems, and competency assessment. The 2013 pilot program involved 36 family medicine, internal medicine, and pediatric faculty members from 12 residencies in four locations., OUTCOMES: The percentage of participants rating intention to implement what was learned as "very likely to" or "absolutely will" was 16/32 (50%) for leadership, 24/33 (72.7%) for change management, 23/33 (69.7%) for systems thinking, 25/32 (75.8%) for population management, 28/33 (84.9%) for teamwork, 29/33 (87.8%) for competency assessment, and 30/31 (96.7%) for patient centeredness.Content analysis revealed five key themes: leadership skills are key drivers of change, but program faculty face big challenges in changing culture and engaging stakeholders; access to data from electronic health records for population management is a universal challenge; readiness to change varies among the three disciplines and among residencies within each discipline; focusing on patients and their needs galvanizes collaborative efforts across disciplines and within residencies; and collaboration among disciplines to develop and use shared measures of residency programs and learner outcomes can guide and inspire program changes and urgently needed educational research., NEXT STEPS: Revise and reevaluate this rapidly evolving program toward widespread engagement with family medicine, internal medicine, and pediatric residencies.

N2  - The Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) Foundation partnered with the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in 1999 to initiate a competitive career development program that provides a financial supplement to surgeon-scientists receiving NIH K08 or K23 career development awards. Because the program has been in existence for 15 years, a review of the program's success has been performed. Between 1999 and 2013, 41 faculty members applied to the SVS Foundation program, and 29 from 21 different institutions were selected as awardees, resulting in a 71% success rate. Three women (10%) were among the 29 awardees. Nine awardees (31%) were supported by prior NIH F32 or T32 training grants. Awardees received their K award at an average of 3.5 years from the start of their faculty position, at the average age of 39.8 years. Thirteen awardees (45%) have subsequently received NIH R01 awards and five (17%) have received Veterans Affairs Merit Awards. Awardees received their first R01 at an average of 5.8 years after the start of their K award at the average age of 45.2 years. The SVS Foundation committed $9,350,000 to the Career Development Award Program. Awardees subsequently secured $45,108,174 in NIH and Veterans Affairs funds, resulting in a 4.8-fold financial return on investment for the SVS Foundation program. Overall, 23 awardees (79%) were promoted from assistant to associate professor in an average of 5.9 years, and 10 (34%) were promoted from associate professor to professor in an average of 5.2 years. Six awardees (21%) hold endowed professorships and four (14%) have secured tenure. Many of the awardees hold positions of leadership, including 12 (41%) as division chief and two (7%) as vice chair within a department of surgery. Eight (28%) awardees have served as president of a regional or national society. Lastly, 47 postdoctoral trainees have been mentored by recipients of the SVS Foundation Career Development Program on training grants or postdoctoral research fellowships. The SVS Foundation Career Development Program has been an effective vehicle to promote the development and independence of vascular surgeon-scientists in the field of academic vascular surgery.Copyright Published by Elsevier Inc.

Y1  - 2015//
N2  - PURPOSE: This article aims to document the process the province of Newfoundland and Labrador used to develop an innovative Physician Management and Leadership Program (PMLP). The PMLP is a collaborative initiative among Memorial University (Faculty of Medicine and Faculty of Business), the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador, and the Regional Health Authorities. As challenges facing health-care systems become more complex there is a growing need for management and leadership training for physicians., DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: Memorial University Faculty of Medicine and the Gardiner Centre in the Faculty of Business in partnership with Regional Health Authorities and the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador identified the need for a leadership and management education program for physician leaders. A provincial needs assessment of physician leaders was conducted to identify educational needs to fill this identified gap. A Steering Committee was formed to guide the design and implementation and monitor delivery of the 10 module Physician Management and Leadership Program (PMLP)., FINDINGS: Designing management and leadership education programs to serve physicians who practice in a large, predominately rural geographic area can be challenging and requires efficient use of available resources and technology., ORIGINALITY/VALUE: While there are many physician management and leadership programs available in Canada and abroad, the PMLP was designed to meet the specific educational needs of physician leaders in Newfoundland and Labrador.

N2  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this paper is to determine the impact of an integrated Medical Leadership Programme (MLP) on a cohort of participating specialty doctors and the NHS services with which they were engaged., DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: This was a qualitative study designed to obtain rich textual data on a novel training intervention. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with participating MLP trainees at fixed points throughout the programme in order to capture their experiences. Resulting data were triangulated with data from extant documentation, including trainees' progress reports and summaries of achievements. Recurring discourses and themes were identified using a framework thematic analysis., FINDINGS: Evidence of the positive impact upon trainees and NHS services was identified, along with challenges. Evidence of impact across all the domains within the national Medical Leadership Competency Framework was also identified, including demonstrating personal qualities, working with others, managing services, improving services and setting direction., RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS: Data were drawn from interviews with a small population of trainees undertaking a pilot MLP in a single deanery, so there are inevitable limitations for generalisability in the quantitative sense. Whilst the pilot trainees were a self-selected group, it was a group of mixed origin and ability., PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: The study has provided valuable lessons for the design of future leadership programmes aimed at doctors in training., ORIGINALITY/VALUE: Identifying the effectiveness of an innovative model of delivery with regard to the Medical Leadership Curriculum may assist with medical staff engagement and support health service improvements to benefit patient care.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the content of conversations, feedback style, and perceived usefulness of feedback to trainee surgeons when conversations were stimulated by a tool for assessing surgeons' non-technical skills., METHODS: Trainee surgeons and their supervisors used the Non-Technical Skills for Surgeons in Denmark tool to stimulate feedback conversations. Audio recordings of post-operation feedback conversations were collected. Trainees and supervisors provided questionnaire responses on the usefulness and comprehensiveness of the feedback. The feedback conversations were qualitatively analyzed for content and feedback style. Usefulness was investigated using a scale from 1 to 5 and written comments were qualitatively analyzed., RESULTS: Six trainees and six supervisors participated in eight feedback conversations. Eighty questionnaires (response rate 83 percent) were collected from 13 trainees and 12 supervisors. Conversations lasted median eight (2-15) minutes. Supervisors used the elements and categories in the tool to structure the content of the conversations. Supervisors tended to talk about the trainees' actions and their own frames rather than attempting to understand the trainees' perceptions. Supervisors and trainees welcomed the feedback opportunity and agreed that the conversations were useful and comprehensive., CONCLUSIONS: The content of the feedback conversations reflected the contents of the tool and the feedback was considered useful and comprehensive. However, supervisors talked primarily about their own frames, so in order for the feedback to reach its full potential, supervisors may benefit from training techniques to stimulate a deeper reflection among trainees.

N2  - IMPORTANCE: The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education core competencies stress nontechnical skills that can be difficult to evaluate and teach to surgical residents. During emergencies, surgeons work in interprofessional teams and are required to perform certain procedures. To obtain proficiency in these skills, residents must be trained., OBJECTIVE: To educate surgical residents in leadership, teamwork, effective communication, and infrequently performed emergency surgical procedures with the use of interprofessional simulations., DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: SimMan 3GS was used to simulate high-risk clinical scenarios (15-20 minutes), followed by debriefings with real-time feedback (30 minutes). A modified Oxford Non-Technical Skills scale (score range, 1-4) was used to assess surgical resident performance during the first half of the academic year (July-December 2012) and the second half of the academic year (January-June 2013). Anonymous online surveys were used to solicit participant feedback. Simulations were conducted in the operating room, intensive care unit, emergency department, ward, and simulation center. A total of 43 surgical residents (postgraduate years [PGYs] 1 and 2) participated in interdisciplinary clinical scenarios, with other health care professionals (nursing, anesthesia, critical care, medicine, respiratory therapy, and pharmacy; mean number of nonsurgical participants/session: 4, range 0-9). Thirty seven surgical residents responded to the survey., EXPOSURES: Simulation of high-risk clinical scenarios: postoperative pulmonary embolus, pneumothorax, myocardial infarction, gastrointestinal bleeding, anaphylaxis with a difficult airway, and pulseless electrical activity arrest., MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Evaluation of resident skills: communication, leadership, teamwork, problem solving, situation awareness, and confidence in performing emergency procedures (eg, cricothyroidotomy)., RESULTS: A total of 31 of 35 (89%) of the residents responding found the sessions useful. Additionally, 28 of 33 (85%) reported improved confidence doing procedures and 29 of 37 (78%) reported knowing when the procedure should be applied. Oxford Non-Technical Skills evaluation demonstrated significant improvement in PGY 2 resident performance assessed during the 2 study periods: communication score increased from 3 to 3.71 (P=.01), leadership score increased from 2.77 to 3.86 (P<.001), teamwork score increased from 3.15 to 3.86 (P=.007), and procedural ability score increased from 2.23 to 3.43 (P=.03). There were no statistically significant improved scores in PGY 2 decision making or situation awareness. No improvements in skills were seen among PGY 1 participants., CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The PGY 2 residents improved their skills, but the PGY 1 residents did not. Participants found interprofessional simulations to be realistic and a valuable educational tool. Interprofessional simulation provides a valuable means of educating surgical residents and evaluating their skills in real-life clinical scenarios.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Physician leadership development programs typically aim to strengthen physicians' leadership competencies and improve organizational performance. We conducted a systematic review of medical literature on physician leadership development programs in order to characterize the setting, educational content, teaching methods, and learning outcomes achieved., METHODS: Articles were identified through a search in Ovid MEDLINE from 1950 through November 2013. We included articles that described programs designed to expose physicians to leadership concepts, outlined teaching methods, and reported evaluation outcomes. A thematic analysis was conducted using a structured data entry form with categories for setting/target group, educational content, format, type of evaluation and outcomes., RESULTS: We identified 45 studies that met eligibility criteria, of which 35 reported on programs exclusively targeting physicians. The majority of programs focused on skills training and technical and conceptual knowledge, while fewer programs focused on personal growth and awareness. Half of the studies used pre/post intervention designs, and four studies used a comparison group. Positive outcomes were reported in all studies, although the majority of studies relied on learner satisfaction scores and self-assessed knowledge or behavioral change. Only six studies documented favorable organizational outcomes, such as improvement in quality indicators for disease management. The leadership programs examined in these studies were characterized by the use of multiple learning methods, including lectures, seminars, group work, and action learning projects in multidisciplinary teams., DISCUSSION: Physician leadership development programs are associated with increased self-assessed knowledge and expertise; however, few studies have examined outcomes at a system level. Our synthesis of the literature suggests important gaps, including a lack of programs that integrate non-physician and physician professionals, limited use of more interactive learning and feedback to develop greater self-awareness, and an overly narrow focus on individual-level rather than system-level outcomes.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Leadership is a key consideration in improving nursing home care quality. Previous research found nursing homes with more credentialed leaders had lower rates of care deficiencies than nursing homes with less credentialed leaders. Evidence that nursing home administrator (NHA) and director of nursing (DON) education and certification is related to resident outcomes is limited., OBJECTIVES: To examine associations of education and certification among NHAs and DONs with resident outcomes., DESIGN: Cross-sectional secondary data analysis., SETTINGS: This study used National Nursing Home Survey data on leadership education and certification and Nursing Home Compare quality outcomes (e.g. pain, catheter use)., PARTICIPANTS: 1142 nursing homes in the survey which represented 16628 nursing homes in the US., METHODS: Leadership education and certification were assessed separately for NHAs and DONs. Nursing home resident outcomes were measured using facility-level nursing home quality indicator rates selected from the Minimum Data Set. Facility-level quality indicators were regressed onto leadership variables in models that also held constant facility size and ownership status., RESULTS: Nursing homes led by NHAs with both Master's degrees or higher and certification had significantly better outcomes for pain. Nursing homes led by DONs with Bachelor's degrees or higher plus certification also had significantly lower pain and catheter use. Whereas pressure ulcer rates were higher in facilities led by DONs with more education., CONCLUSIONS: Selected outcomes for nursing home residents might be improved by increasing the education and certification requirements for NHAs and DONs. Additional research is needed to clarify these relationships.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - BACKGROUND: This study explores the nature and the intention of attending surgeons' guiding behaviors performed in the operating room (OR) in order to build taxonomy of OR guiding behavior., METHODS: Nine attending surgeons and 8 surgical residents were invited to observe 8 prerecorded surgical cases from 4 common procedures and completed semistructured interviews. All video-based observations were videotaped. Thematic analysis was applied to identify surgeons' OR guiding behavior., RESULTS: Seven hundred eighty minutes of video-based observations with interviews were conducted. Sixteen types of OR guiding behaviors in 3 intention-based categories were identified: 3 of the 16 was "teaching" (18.75%), 8 of the 16 was "directing" (50%), and 5 of the 16 was "assisting" (31.25%)., CONCLUSIONS: Surgeons' OR guiding behaviors were grounded in 3 behavioral intentions: teaching, directing, and assisting. This taxonomy of OR guiding behavior can be used as a basis for developing OR guiding strategy to improve residents' intraoperative competency, autonomy, and independence.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - PROBLEM: Many health care organizations seek physicians to lead quality improvement (QI) efforts, yet struggle to find individuals with the necessary expertise. Although most residency programs incorporate QI and patient safety principles into their curricula, few provide a specialized training program for residents exploring careers as physician leaders in quality., APPROACH: Recognizing this training void, the authors designed and implemented the Healthcare Leadership in Quality (HLQ) track for residents at the University of Pennsylvania Health System in 2010. This longitudinal, two-year graduate medical education (GME) track aligns with the quality goals of the University of Pennsylvania Health System and includes a core curriculum, integration into an interprofessional health care leadership team that is accountable for quality and safety outcomes on a hospital unit, a capstone QI project, and mentorship., OUTCOMES: Early evaluation has demonstrated the feasibility and efficacy of the track diverse graduate medical education training programs. Using Yardley and Dornan's interpretation of the Kirkpatrick framework, the authors have demonstrated the track's impact on four levels of educational and organizational outcomes., NEXT STEPS: Building on their early experiences, the authors are integrating project and time management skills into the core curriculum, and they are focusing more effort on faculty development in QI mentorship. Additionally, the authors plan to follow HLQ track graduates to determine whether they seek leadership roles in quality and safety and to assess the influence of the program on their careers.

N2  - This national investigation utilizes qualitative data to evaluate an implementation model regarding factors influencing provider use of two evidence-based treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Semi-structured qualitative interviews with 198 mental health providers from 38 Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) residential treatment programs were used to explore these issues regarding prolonged exposure (PE) and cognitive processing therapy (CPT) in VA residential PTSD programs. Several unique and some overlapping predictors emerged. Leadership was viewed as an influence on implementation for both CPT and PE, while a lack of dedicated time and resources was viewed as a deterrent for both. Compatibility of CPT with providers' existing practices and beliefs, the ability to observe noticeable patient improvement, a perceived relative advantage of CPT over alternative treatments, and the presence of a supportive peer network emerged as influential on CPT implementation. Leadership was associated with PE implementation. Implications for the design and improvement of training and implementation efforts are discussed.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Cardiopulmonary arrests are rare, high-stakes events that benefit from using crisis resource management (CRM). Simulation-based education with deliberate practice can promote skill acquisition., OBJECTIVE: We assessed whether using simulation-based education to teach CRM would lead to improved performance, compared to a lecture format., METHODS: We tested third-year internal medicine residents in simulated code scenarios. Participants were randomly assigned to simulation-based education with deliberate practice (SIM) group or lecture (LEC) group. We created a checklist of CRM critical actions (which includes announcing the diagnosis, asking for help/suggestions, and assigning tasks), and reviewed videotaped performances, using a checklist of skills and communications patterns to identify CRM skills and communication efforts. Subjects were tested in simulated code scenarios 6 months after the initial assessment., RESULTS: At baseline, all 52 subjects recognized distress, and 92% (48 of 52) called for help. Seventy-eight percent (41 of 52) did not succeed in resuscitating the simulated patient or demonstrate the CRM skills. After intervention, both groups (n = 26 per group) improved. All SIM subjects announced the diagnosis compared to 65% LEC subjects (17 of 26, P = .01); 77% (20 of 26) SIM and 19% (5 of 26) LEC subjects asked for suggestions (P<.001); and 100% (26 of 26) SIM and 27% (7 of 26) LEC subjects assigned tasks (P<.001)., CONCLUSIONS: The SIM intervention resulted in significantly improved team communication and cardiopulmonary arrest management. During debriefing, participants acknowledged the benefit of the SIM sessions.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to examine the experiences of prior governing council (GC) members of the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) Section for Residents and Fellows-in-Training (SRF) and assess the impact of early Academy involvement. A survey was conducted via email on all prior AAO-HNS SRF GC members. The AAO-HNS SRF has elected 52 GC members since its 2003 inception. Each member served an average of 1.5 year-long terms. The mean time since completion of training is 4.1 years. A subspecialty fellowship was pursued in 86%. Fifty-seven percent practice in academic settings, with 3 members advancing to subspecialty division director within their department. More than half (58%) have served on an AAO-HNS committee, and most are frequent attendees of the annual meeting. All prior members felt involvement in the SRF GC was beneficial, enabling them to gain leadership skills and deeper understanding of the specialty.Copyright © American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation 2014.

N2  - Psychiatrists of the future will be called upon to lead teams of clinicians in increasingly complex medical care systems, but will they be prepared for those roles? The authors of this column asked alumni of the Columbia University Public Psychiatry Fellowship (PPF) to identify important skills and knowledge that were not stressed in general residency education. "Silos are rampant in our work," complained one respondent, reflecting a common concern that not enough time was spent teaching residents to collaborate.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Effective clinical leadership is associated with better patient care. We implemented and evaluated a pilot clinical leadership course for second year internal medicine residents at a large United States Academic Medical Center that is part of a multi-hospital health system., METHODS: The course met weekly for two to three hours during July, 2013. Sessions included large group discussions and small group reflection meetings. Topics included leadership styles, emotional intelligence, and leading clinical teams. Course materials were designed internally and featured "business school style" case studies about everyday clinical medicine which explore how leadership skills impact care delivery. Participants evaluated the course's impact and quality using a post-course survey. Questions were structured in five point likert scale and free text format. Likert scale responses were converted to a 1-5 scale (1 = strongly disagree; 3 = neither agree nor disagree; 5 = strongly agree), and means were compared to the value 3 using one-way T-tests. Responses to free text questions were analyzed using the constant comparative method., RESULTS: All sixteen pilot course participants completed the survey. Participants overwhelmingly agreed that the course provided content and skills relevant to their clinical responsibilities and leadership roles. Most participants also acknowledged that taking the course improved their understanding of their strengths and weaknesses as leaders, different leadership styles, and how to manage interpersonal conflict on clinical teams. 88% also reported that the course increased their interest in pursuing additional leadership training., CONCLUSIONS: A clinical leadership course for internal medicine residents designed by colleagues, and utilizing case studies about clinical medicine, resulted in significant self-reported improvements in clinical leadership competencies.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Our aim was to determine if a surgeon's behaviors can encourage or discourage trainees from speaking up when they witness a surgical mistake., STUDY DESIGN: A randomized clinical trial in which medical students (n = 55) were randomly assigned to an "encouraged" (n = 28) or "discouraged" (n = 27) group. Participants underwent personality tests to assess decision-making styles, and were then trained on basic tasks ("burn" then "cut") on a laparoscopic surgery simulator. After randomization, students assisted at a simulated laparoscopic salpingectomy. The senior surgeon used either an "encourage" script (eg, "Your opinion is important.") or a "discourage" script (eg, "Do what I say. Save questions for next time."). Otherwise, the surgery was conducted identically. Subsequently, a surgical mistake was made by the senior surgeon when he instructed students to cut without burning. Students were considered to have spoken up if they questioned the instruction and did not cut. Potential personality bias was assessed with two validated personality tests before simulation. Data were processed with Mann-Whitney and Fisher exact tests., RESULTS: The students in the encouraged group were significantly more likely to speak up (23 of 28 [82%] vs 8 of 27 [30%]; p < 0.001). There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in personality traits, student training level (p = 1.0), or sex (p = 0.53)., CONCLUSIONS: A discouraging environment decreases the frequency with which trainees speak up when witnessing a surgical error. The senior surgeon plays an important role in improving intraoperative communication between junior and senior clinicians and can enhance patient safety.Copyright © 2014 American College of Surgeons.

T1  - Improving business IQ in medicine through mentorship and education.
A1  - Hill, Austin D
Y1  - 2014//
N2  - Business intelligence in the field of medicine, particularly with physicians, has been an abstract concept at best with no objective metric. Furthermore, in many arenas, it was taboo for medical students, residents, and physicians to discuss the business and finances of their work for fear that it would interfere with their sacred duties as health care providers. There has been a substantial shift in this philosophy over the last few decades with the growth and evolution of the health care industry in the United States. In 2012, health care expenditures accounted for 17.2% of the United States Gross Domestic Product, averaging $8915 per person. The passage of the Affordable Care Act in March of 2010 sent a clear message to all that change is coming, and it is more important now than ever to have physician leaders whose skills and knowledge in business, management, and health care law rival their acumen within their medical practice. Students, residents, and fellows all express a desire to gain more business knowledge throughout their education and training, but many do not know where to begin or have access to programs that can further their knowledge. Whether you are an employed or private practice physician, academic or community based, improving your business intelligence will help you get a seat at the table where decisions are made and give you the skills to influence those decisions.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: The 'enhancing human resources and the use of appropriate technologies for maternal and perinatal survival in sub-Saharan Africa' (ETATMBA) project is training emergency obstetric and new-born care (EmONC) non-physician clinicians (NPCs) as advanced clinical leaders. Our objectives were to evaluate the implementation and changes to practice., DESIGN: A mixed methods process evaluation with the predominate methodology being qualitative., SETTING: Rural and urban hospitals in 8 of the 14 districts of northern and central Malawi., PARTICIPANTS: 54 EmONC NPCs with 3 years' plus experience., INTERVENTION: Training designed and delivered by clinicians from the UK and Malawi; it is a 2-year plus package of training (classroom, mentorship and assignments)., RESULTS: We conducted 79 trainee interviews over three time points during the training, as well as a convenience sample of 10 colleagues, 7 district officers and 2 UK obstetricians. Trainees worked in a context of substantial variation in the rates of maternal and neonatal deaths between districts. Training reached trainees working across the target regions. For 46 trainees (8 dropped out of the course), dose delivered in terms of attendance was high and all 46 spent time working alongside an obstetrician. In early interviews trainees recalled course content unprompted indicating training had been received. Colleagues and district officers reported cascading of knowledge and initial changes in practice indicating early implementation. By asking trainees to describe actual cases we found they had implemented new knowledge and skills. These included life-saving interventions for postpartum haemorrhage and eclampsia. Trainees identified the leadership training as enabling them to confidently change their own practice and initiate change in their health facility., CONCLUSIONS: This process evaluation suggests that trainees have made positive changes in their practice. Clear impacts on maternal and perinatal mortality are yet to be elucidated.Copyright Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

T1  - Redefining the measure of medical education: harnessing the transformative potential of MEPI.
A1  - Kim, Jim Yong
A1  - Evans, Timothy G
Y1  - 2014//
N2  - The massive shortage of skilled health professionals in many parts of the world is a critical constraint to achieving the goal of universal health coverage. This shortfall reflects a generalized failure of leadership: a chronic misalignment between the direction of health professional education and the health goals of society. The Medical Education Partnership Initiative (MEPI) and Nurse Education Partnership Initiative (NEPI) are outliers in this regard through their deliberate efforts to revitalize education to address the pressing health needs of Sub-Saharan Africa. Inspired by this example, the World Bank Group sees health professional education institutions (HPEIs) as an insufficiently tapped source of knowledge and know-how for accelerating health achievement. The challenge ahead is to articulate clearer expectations for HPEI performance, marshal more and smarter investments across the public and private sectors, prioritize accountability, incentivize innovation, and strengthen global learning and evaluation. It is time to build on the positive legacy of MEPI/NEPI and ensure that the conditions are made available for a new generation of health workers with the competencies to meet the health and development challenges of today and tomorrow.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this pilot study was to determine what influence a nurse residency program (NRP) has on long-term outcomes including turnover rates, career satisfaction, and leadership development., BACKGROUND: Studies examining short-term outcomes of NRPs have shown positive effects. Long-term studies of NRPs have not been reported., METHODS: This descriptive study surveyed former nurse residents, still employed at the facility. Data were collected by means of a demographic tool and the McCloskey/Mueller Satisfaction Scale, a job satisfaction tool., RESULTS: Although nursing turnover increased past the yearlong residency program, it remained well below the national average. All components of satisfaction were ranked relatively high, but coworker/peer support was most important to job satisfaction. Leadership development in the areas of certification and pursuing an advanced degree increased with longer employment, but hospital committee involvement decreased with successive cohorts., CONCLUSION: Overall, the long-term outcomes of an NRP appear to have benefits to both the organization and the individual.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The post-take ward round (PTWR) provides formal consultant review of acutely unwell patients admitted to hospital, yet specialist medical registrars, the consultants of tomorrow, receive little to no formal training in this area. There is an expectation that 'on the job' experience will provide sufficient preparation for this important aspect of clinical leadership., METHODS: We aimed to seek the opinions of medical registrars on the use of a structured considerative checklist and learning-by-example approach in PTWR leadership training, assessing whether this model influences current and future practice. This was studied through a questionnaire-based survey of medical registrars working in Worthing Hospital from 2009 to 2011., RESULTS: Eighteen of 25 registrars (72%) across a range of specialties returned questionnaires. Although a third of respondents had spent time considering how they conduct ward rounds, none had received formal training, with most feeling that ward round skills were acquired 'on the job' from observation and experience of those conducted by senior colleagues. Exposure to the considerative checklist changed thinking in 94 per cent and changed practice in 88 per cent. Common positive themes included enhanced pre-ward round preparation, the importance of inclusion and communication, and the need for structure (facilitated by physical or mental checklist). Seventeen of 18 participants felt that this training would influence their consultant practice., DISCUSSION: Trainees respond positively to participation in a structured PTWR using a considerative checklist as a model of good practice, leading to changes in their current and future practice, and could be considered as a training tool.Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to describe a successful and exportable training module that addresses Next Accreditation System (NAS) behavioral milestones for leadership competencies., METHODS: A novel leadership training module, which required the creation of original business plans by teams of residents, was incorporated into a psychiatry PGY-2 training curriculum., RESULTS: In the creation and presentation of their business plans, the residents demonstrated competencies in the NAS functional domains of interpersonal and communication skills, professionalism, practice-based learning and improvement, and systems-based practice. Residents who responded with feedback after completing the course were very positive about their experience., CONCLUSIONS: The leadership training module described here allowed residents to acquire and demonstrate many of the competencies specified in leadership-oriented NAS milestones. The module did not require additional funding or a formal rotation or "track," is scalable to accommodate any number of residents and can be modified based on available local teaching resources.

T1  - The importance of a supportive environment in clinical audit: a pilot study of doctors' engagement with the NHS National PET-CT audit programme.

N2  - PURPOSE: The NHS National PET-CT Audit Programme was launched in 2008 as part of a national NHS programme to widen patient access to PET-computed tomography (CT) imaging in England. However, to implement clinical audit effectively, healthcare professionals need to be fully engaged with the process. The purpose of the pilot study was to identify and explore the different factors that influence doctors' engagement with the National NHS PET-CT Audit Programme., METHODS: A single embedded case study was undertaken, which centred on the NHS National PET-CT Audit Programme. Seven theoretical propositions drawn from a review of the literature were tested and their influence evaluated. A purposeful sample of 13 semistructured interviews with consultant doctors was taken from different hospitals over a 6-month period. The data were analysed using directed thematic content analysis, with the themes compared against the study's propositions., RESULTS: Doctors' perspectives of clinical audit changed in response to the way in which the audit was implemented. The main barriers to engagement were the lack of a common vision and poor communication, which contributed to poor interprofessional relationships and a perceived culture of blame. In contrast, factors that facilitated engagement centred on the adoption of a more supportive and collaborative approach, which in turn facilitated higher levels of trust between professionals. The dissemination of performance data was found to be a key influencing factor., CONCLUSION: The study makes use of a unique data set and to the best of our knowledge is one of the first studies to document how the dissemination of doctors' performance data positively influences engagement with clinical audit in England. In addition, the study also shows how, contrary to some studies in the literature, clinical audit can reduce professional anxiety by providing a validation of professional competence. The study supports the premise that clinical audit will be fully embraced by doctors only if they are sufficiently involved in the process so as to be able to redefine and clarify its purpose and meaning. The preliminary findings of this pilot study provide the theoretical underpinning for a national survey into reporter perspectives of the National PET-CT Audit Programme.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Residency training is a critical time for physicians' professional formation. However, few structured interventions exist to support residents in this transformative process of integrating personal and professional values, a process that is essential to physician identity formation and preservation of core values such as service and compassion., PURPOSES: The authors created a seminar series, the "Forum," to support resident professional formation and address the hidden curriculum as part of a larger intervention to support self-directed learning skills such as goal setting and reflection., METHODS: Ninety-minute sessions with senior residents and faculty held every other month include opportunities for individual reflection, small- and large-group discussion, and brief didactic components focused on skills such as teaching and leadership. The qualitative program evaluation included analyses of individual semistructured interviews with resident and faculty participants from 2008 to 2011 and of notes recorded by an observer during the 1st year's sessions., RESULTS: Residents appreciated the focus on relevant issues, presence of faculty, opportunities for reflection and interactivity, and inclusion of practical skills. Effects attributed to the Forum included gaining practical skills, feeling a deeper connection to one another and a sense of community, and recognizing progress in their own professional development and growth. Elements described in the literature as essential to professional formation, including encouraging reflection, use of narrative, role modeling, addressing the hidden curriculum, and fostering an authentic community, were recognized by participants as integral to the Forum's success., CONCLUSIONS: A group forum for reflection and discussion with peers and role models, tailored to local needs, offers an effective structure to foster professional formation in residency.

N2  - A key facet of professional development is the formation of professional identity. At its most basic level, professional identity for a scientist centers on mastery of a discipline and the development of research skills during doctoral training. To develop a broader understanding of professional identity in the context of doctoral training, the Carnegie Initiative on the Doctorate (CID) ran a multi-institutional study from 2001 to 2005. A key outcome of the CID was the development of the concept of 'stewards of the discipline'. The Interdisciplinary Program in Neuroscience (IPN) at Georgetown University participated in CID from 2003 to 2005. Here, we describe the IPN and highlight the programmatic developments resulting from participation in the CID. In particular, we emphasize programmatic activities that are designed to promote professional skills in parallel with scientific development. We describe activities in the domains of leadership, communication, teaching, public outreach, ethics, collaboration, and mentorship. Finally, we provide data that demonstrate that traditional metrics of academic success are not adversely affected by the inclusion of professional development activities in the curricula. By incorporating these seven 'professional development' activities into the required coursework and dissertation research experience, the IPN motivates students to become stewards of the discipline.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Program directors have a formal leading position within a teaching team. It is not clear how program directors fulfill their leadership role in practice. In this interview study we aim to explore the role of the program director as strategic leader, based on the research-question: What are the experiences of program directors with strategic leadership?, METHOD: We conducted an interview study using the principles of phenomenography to explore program directors' experiences. In the period June 2012-May 2013, 16 program directors from different hospital organisations were invited to participate in an interview study. Iterative data collection and analysis were based on strategic leadership: (1) developing collective mindset, (2) focusing on collaborative learning and (3) designing teaching organisation., RESULTS: Fourteen program directors participated in this study. We identified four leadership profiles: (1) captains, (2) carers, (3) professionals and (4) team-players. The 'team-players' come closest to integrally applying strategic leadership. For all four profiles there seems to be a preference for developing collectivity by means of providing information. Program directors have less experience with promoting collaborative learning and the designing of teaching organisation is task-oriented., CONCLUSION: Promoting collaborative learning is the most important challenge for developing leadership within the teaching team.

N2  - BACKGROUND: One in four adults are estimated to be at medium to high risk of malnutrition when screened using the 'Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool' upon admission to hospital in the United Kingdom. The Need for Nutrition Education/Education Programme (NNEdPro) Group was developed to address this issue and the Nutrition Education and Leadership for Improved Clinical Outcomes (NELICO) is a project within this group.The objective of NELICO was to assess whether an intensive training intervention combining clinical and public health nutrition, organisational management and leadership strategies, could equip junior doctors to contribute to improvement in nutrition awareness among healthcare professionals in the National Health Service in England., METHODS: Three junior doctors were self-selected from the NNEdPro Group original training. Each junior doctor recruited three additional team members to attend an intensive training weekend incorporating nutrition, change management and leadership. This equipped them to run nutrition awareness weeks in their respective hospitals. Knowledge, attitudes and practices were evaluated at baseline as well as one and four months post-training as a quality assurance measure. The number and type of educational events held, pre-awareness week Online Hospital Survey results, attendance and qualitative feedback from training sessions, effectiveness of dissemination methods such as awareness stalls, Hospital Nutrition Attitude Survey results and overall feedback were also used to determine impact., RESULTS: When the weighted average score for knowledge, attitudes and practices at baseline was compared with four months post-intervention scores, there was a significant increase in the overall score (p=0.03). All three hospital teams conducted an effective nutrition awareness week, as determined by qualitative data collected from interviews and feedback from educational sessions., CONCLUSION: The NELICO project and its resulting nutrition awareness weeks were considered innovative in terms of concept and content. It was considered useful, both for the junior doctors who showed improvement in their nutrition knowledge and reported enthusiasm and for the hospital setting, increasing awareness of clinical and public health nutrition among healthcare professionals. The NELICO project is one innovative method to promote nutrition awareness in tomorrow's doctors and shows they have the enthusiasm and drive to be nutrition champions.

N2  - The benefits of nurse residency programs are well documented from the perspective of the nurse resident. To justify the resource investments of time and money, effectiveness and value for all stakeholders must be measured. The purpose of this study was to examine nurse leaders' perceptions of effectiveness and return on investment of a nurse residency program. The investigators found that hospitals may experience a return on investment and nurses' enculturation occurred more quickly.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Rural surgeons have unique learning needs not easily met by traditional continuing medical education courses., METHODS: A multidisciplinary team developed and implemented a skills curriculum focused on leadership and communication, advanced endoscopy, emergency urology, emergency gynecology, facial plastic surgery, ultrasound, and management of fingertip amputations., RESULTS: Twenty-five of 30 (89%) rural surgeons who completed a follow-up course evaluation reported that the knowledge acquired during the course had improved their practice and/or the quality of patient care, particularly by refining commonly used skills and expanding the care options they could offer to their patients. The surgeons reported incorporating changes in their communication and interaction with colleagues., CONCLUSIONS: This course was successful, from participants' perspectives, in providing hands-on mentored training for a variety of skills that reflect the broad scope of practice of surgeons in rural areas. Attendees felt that their participation resulted in important behavior and practice changes.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Y1  - 2014//
N2  - PURPOSE: To determine a consensus definition of a clinician-educator and the related domains of competence., METHOD: During September 2010 to March 2011, the authors conducted a two-phase mixed-methods national study in Canada using (1) focus groups of deans of medicine and directors of medical education centers to define the attributes, domains of competence, and core competencies of clinician-educators using a grounded theory analysis, and (2) a survey of 1,130 deans, academic chairs, and residency program directors to validate the focus group results., RESULTS: The 22 focus group participants described being active in clinical practice, applying theory to practice, and engaging in education scholarship-but not holding a particular administrative position-as essential attributes of clinician-educators. Program directors accounted for 68% of the 350 survey respondents, academic chairs for 19%, and deans for 13% (response rate: 31%). Among respondents, 85% endorsed the need for physicians with advanced training in medical education to serve as educational consultants. Domains of clinician-educator competence endorsed by >85% of respondents as important or very important were assessment, communication, curriculum development, education theory, leadership, scholarship, and teaching. With regard to training requirements, 55% endorsed a master's degree in education as effective preparation, whereas 39% considered faculty development programs effective., CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of this study's findings, the authors defined a clinician-educator as a clinician active in health professional practice who applies theory to education practice, engages in education scholarship, and serves as a consultant to other health professionals on education issues.

T1  - Expanding the scope of leadership training in medicine.
A1  - Gabel, Stewart
Y1  - 2014//
N2  - All physicians take a leadership role at some point in their career-some exert influence in their practices and communities as informal leaders, and others hold formal leadership roles to which they are appointed or elected. These formal leadership roles convey power to those individuals who hold such positions. Formal leadership, however, is limited in its influence unless it is accompanied by a series of personal and interpersonal competencies that characterize both formal and informal leaders.Many physicians who do not hold formal leadership roles will be called on to provide (or will wish to provide) informal leadership at various times in their careers. Both formal and informal leaders should be trained in the personal and interpersonal competencies necessary for effective leadership to advance the principles-driven and values-oriented goals inherent in the health care enterprise.In this article, the author defines leadership and describes the characteristics of formal and informal leaders, then discusses the types of leadership and the power derived from different leadership roles. He concludes by arguing in favor of expanding the scope of leadership training to include informal as well as formal leaders.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The authors queried attendees to a chief resident conference on whether program education and training in neuroscience or in translating neuroscience research into practice is sufficient and what changes are needed., METHODS: The authors developed and administered a 26-item voluntary questionnaire to each attendee at the Chief Residents' Leadership Conference at the American Psychiatric Association 2013 annual meeting in San Francisco, CA., RESULTS: Out of 94 attendees, 55 completed and returned questionnaires (58.5%). A majority of respondents stated that their program provided adequate training in neuroscience (61.8%); opportunities for neuroscience research existed for them (78.2%), but that their program did not prepare them for translating future neuroscience research findings into clinical practice (78.9%) or educate them on the NIMH Research Domain Criteria (83.3%). A majority of respondents stated that the ACGME should require a specific neuroscience curriculum (79.6%)., CONCLUSION: Chief residents believe that curricular and cultural change is needed in psychiatry residency neuroscience education.

N2  - Mannequin-based simulation in graduate medical education has gained widespread acceptance. Its use in non-procedural training within internal medicine (IM) remains scant, possibly due to the logistical barriers to implementation of simulation curricula in large residency programs. We report the Massachusetts General Hospital Department of Medicine's scale-up of a voluntary pilot program to a mandatory longitudinal simulation curriculum in a large IM residency program (n=54). We utilized an eight-case curriculum implemented over the first four months of the academic year. An intensive care unit curriculum was piloted in the spring. In order to administer a comprehensive curriculum in a large residency program where faculty resources are limited, thirty second-year and third-year residents served as session facilitators and two senior residents served as chairpersons of the program. Post-session anonymous survey revealed high learner satisfaction scores for the mandatory program, similar to those of the voluntary pilot program. Most interns believed the sessions should continue to be mandatory. Utilizing residents as volunteer facilitators and program leaders allowed the implementation of a well-received mandatory simulation program in a large IM residency program and facilitated program sustainability.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Although leadership is a core component of the work life of physicians, most physicians are ill-prepared to assume leadership roles upon completion of residency training. The authors sought to determine if medical residents could learn the components of emotional intelligence and thereby facilitate improved leadership styles., METHODS: The authors created an educational workshop that included readings (provided to attendees in preparation for the workshop), a formalized presentation on emotional intelligence, and role-playing of scenarios (with debriefing and discussion) involving leadership opportunities., RESULTS: The majority of participants reported that they left the workshop more informed about leadership and with more skills that could enhance their roles as leaders., CONCLUSIONS: While enhancing knowledge and skills, which were demonstrated after attendance at a seminar, additional measures of effective leadership are still needed.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Creating training opportunities for the development of effective leaders is an increasingly important goal in psychiatry residency training programs. This article examines the long-term perceived impact of the Tarrytown Chief Residents Leadership Conference on preparing psychiatric residents for future leadership positions., METHODS: Self-report surveys from attendees who participated in the conference between 1998 and 2011 were examined., RESULTS: Five hundred and forty-one completed surveys were returned (43 % response rate). Eighty-six percent of respondents reported moderate to extreme improvement in leadership confidence post-conference. Most respondents indicated at least moderate improvement in self-awareness (93 %), understanding of group process (92 %), and willingness to address conflict (89 %). Ninety percent felt the conference was important to their residency training, and 80 % indicated increased interest in leadership post-conference., CONCLUSIONS: Responders reported lasting improvements in their confidence in and perceived ability to utilize skills necessary for effective leadership, demonstrating the value of this experiential learning opportunity.

N2  - Many psychiatry residency graduates end up practicing at least in part in community settings. However, declining funding and other issues prevent many residency programs from offering robust community psychiatry training to all of their residents. Accordingly, some residency programs have developed Community Psychiatry Tracks, with the goal of developing future leaders in public sector psychiatry. We cataloged US psychiatry residency programs offering Community Psychiatry Tracks by reviewing the literature and surveying training directors and members of the American Association of Community Psychiatrists. Authors from each of the four programs found to be actively offering such tracks describe their track curricula, from which we elucidated common and variable elements as well as strengths and weaknesses and then make recommendations for other programs wishing to start a track. A Community Psychiatry Track preliminarily appears to be a well-received way to offer enhanced Community Psychiatry training to interested residents, to recruit medical students to residency programs, to offer opportunities for collaboration between residents and faculty members, and to expand opportunities for scholarly work by residents.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Health care institutions have adapted residency programs to help new graduate nurses to become fully competent and transition from a student nurse to an independent practicing nurse and a bedside leader., OBJECTIVES: The study's aim is to review the literature on the impact of residency programs on new graduate nurses' clinical decision-making and leadership skills., REVIEW METHODS: An electronic search was conducted between 1980 and 2013 using databases of the scientific literature in Medline, PubMed, Cochrane EPOC, Cumulative Index to Nursing & Allied Health Literature database guide (CINAHL), and PsychInfo using a range of keywords. Information gathered was evaluated for relevance., RESULTS: Thirteen studies that met the inclusion criteria were used in this systematic review. In several studies considered in this review, residency programs were developed to improve new graduates skills and promote their transition into the nursing workforce. In fact, the transition programs reduced turnover in that first year of practice and promoted professional growth of the new graduate such as hand-on nursing skills, clinical decision-making and leadership skills, satisfaction, and retention., CONCLUSION: There is a need for effective residency programs that are designed to prepare new graduate nurses in providing safe, competent and effective patient care.Copyright © 2013.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The Emergency Medicine In-Training Examination (EMITE) is one of the only valid tools for medical knowledge assessment in current use by emergency medicine (EM) residencies. However, EMITE results return late in the academic year, providing little time to institute potential remediation., OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to determine the ability of EM faculty to accurately predict resident EMITE scores prior to results return., METHODS: We asked EM faculty at the study site to predict the 2012 EMITE scores of the 50 EM residents 2 weeks prior to results being available. The primary outcome was prediction accuracy, defined as the proportion of predictions within 6% of the actual score. The secondary outcome was prediction precision, defined as the mean deviation of predictions from the actual scores. We assessed several faculty background variables, including years of experience, educational leadership status, and clinical hours worked, for correlation with the two outcomes., RESULTS: Thirty-two of the 38 faculty (84.2%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 69.6-92.6) participated in the study, rendering a total of 1600 predictions for 50 residents. Mean resident EMITE score was 81.1% (95% CI 79.5-82.8%). Mean prediction accuracy for all faculty participants was 69% (95% CI 65.9-72.1%). Mean prediction precision was 5.2% (95% CI 4.9-5.5%). Education leadership status was the only background variable correlated with the primary and secondary outcomes (Spearman's p = 0.51 and -0.53, respectively)., CONCLUSION: Faculty possess only moderate accuracy at predicting resident EMITE scores. We recommend a multicenter study to evaluate the generalizability of the present results.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - In this participatory action research study, researchers conducted a total of 3 implementation cycles to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a new delirium prevention program (DPP) for cognitively impaired residents in long term care (LTC) settings. Researchers interviewed 95 health care staff to obtain feedback on their use of the DPP and then modified the DPP and tested the changes in the next implementation cycle. Our results indicated that the DPP was feasible and that health care staff would accept it under certain conditions. We found there were 4 keys to successful implementation of the DPP: support for the program from both the administration and the users; effective clinician leadership to ensure proper delivery of the DPP (format, content and values) and its appropriate adaptation to the LTC facility's internal culture and policies; a sense of ownership among the DPP users; and, last, practical hands-on training as well as theoretical training for staff.

N2  - The diverse attitudes and motivations of surgeons and surgical trainees within different age groups present an important challenge for surgical leaders and educators. These challenges to surgical leadership are not unique, and other industries have likewise needed to grapple with how best to manage these various age groups. The authors will herein explore management and leadership for surgeons in a time of age diversity, define generational variations within "Baby-Boomer", "Generation X" and "Generation Y" populations, and identify work ethos concepts amongst these three groups. The surgical community must understand and embrace these concepts in order to continue to attract a stellar pool of applicants from medical school. By not accepting the changing attitudes and motivations of young trainees and medical students, we may disenfranchise a high percentage of potential future surgeons. Surgical training programs will fill, but will they contain the highest quality trainees?

Y1  - 2014//
N2  - As laboratories are challenged to do more with fewer resources, the pathologist and laboratory director will play a greater role in improving the effectiveness of the laboratory, as well as addressing the overuse, misuse and underuse of laboratory testing. We describe the necessary characteristics for pathologists and laboratory directors to successfully lead utilization efforts, as well as key leadership tools and essential steps in creating a utilization management program. When we established a laboratory test utilization program de novo, it became clear how important the laboratory director was in guiding those initiatives by working with stakeholders outside of the laboratory, particularly clinicians, nurses and administrators.

Y1  - 2014//
N2  - Future physician leaders will need the knowledge and skills necessary to improve systems of care. To address this need, Pritzker School of Medicine implemented a 4-year scholarly track in quality and patient safety for medical students. The Quality and Safety Track (QST) includes an intensive elective that teaches basic quality-improvement skills, an individual mentored scholarly project, and engagement in the Institute for Healthcare Improvement Open School. The first-year elective incorporates a group project that allows students to apply basic process improvement skills. Institutional quality and safety leaders also present their work, giving students context for how these skills are used. To date, 23 students have completed the elective, and 11 chose to pursue QST throughout their medical school experience. Students who completed the elective reported improved confidence in using core quality improvement skills. QST is a feasible and innovative program to develop future health care leaders in quality and safety. Copyright © 2013 by the American College of Medical Quality.

N2  - AIM OF THE STUDY: To establish an inventory of the training facilities available to residents and chief-residents in visceral and digestive surgery in France and to assess their satisfaction and their expectations., PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: An anonymous questionnaire was sent by E-mail in 2011 to all residents and chief-residents in visceral and digestive surgery in France. The questionnaire addressed demographic characteristics, educational resources used and desired, as well as the current medical and university curriculum. The practical and theoretical aspects of training were evaluated., RESULTS: Of 208 residents, 63% responded to the survey (96 residents and 35 chief-residents). Daily practice of surgery and the reading of English-language articles were the two most frequently used teaching resources. Surgical training was judged satisfactory by 41.2% of respondents. In multivariate analysis, only the function of chief-resident (p < 0.001) and authorship as first author of scientific papers (p = 0.041) were associated with a feeling of satisfaction. Surgical training on animals, use of online course materials, and the establishment of a mentoring process during residency were rated favorable by more than 80%., CONCLUSIONS: The majority of residents and chief-residents in visceral and digestive surgery in France believe their training is unsatisfactory. However, this dissatisfaction decreases progressively throughout the training period. Strengthening of companionship through tutoring, better information on existing resources, and improved access to surgical training in animals should enhance satisfaction.

N2  - Introduction Surgical Training and Education in Promoting Professionalism (STEPP) was developed in 2011 to train tomorrow's leaders during residency. It is based on virtue ethics and takes an approach similar to West Point military academy. The purpose of this research was: (i) to compare the virtue profiles of our residents with that of the military cohort using a standardized virtue assessment tool; and (ii) to assess the value of virtue education on residents. Methods As part of STEPP, otolaryngology residents participated in a virtue-based validated assessment tool called Virtue in Action (VIA) Inventory. This was completed at the initiation of STEPP in July 2011 as well as 1 year later in June 2012. Comparison of the VIA to a military cohort was performed. Leadership 'Basic Training' is a series of forums focused on virtues of initiative, integrity, responsibility, self-discipline, and accountability. A pre- and post-test was administered assessing resident perceptions of the value of this 'Basic Training'. Results Virtues are shared between otolaryngology residents (n=9) and military personnel (n=2,433) as there were no significant differences in strength scores between two military comparison groups and otolaryngology-head and neck surgery (OHNS) residents. There was a significant improvement (p<0.001) in the understanding of components of the leadership vision and a significant improvement in the understanding of key leadership concepts based on 'Basic Training'. All residents responded in the post-test that the STEPP program was valuable, up from 56%. Conclusions A virtue-based approach is valued by residents as a part of leadership training during residency.

Y1  - 2013//
N2  - OBJECTIVE: To assist curriculum committees and leadership instructors by gathering expert opinion to define student leadership development competencies for pharmacy curricula., METHODS: Twenty-six leadership instructors participated in a 3-round, online, modified Delphi process to define competencies for student leadership development in pharmacy curricula. Round 1 asked open-ended questions about leadership knowledge, skills, and attitudes. Round 2 grouped responses for agreement rating and comment. Round 3 allowed rating and comment on competencies not yet meeting consensus, which was prospectively set at 80%., RESULTS: Eleven competencies attained 80% consensus or higher and were grouped into 3 areas: leadership knowledge, personal leadership commitment, and leadership skill development. Connections to contemporary leadership development literature were outlined for each competency as a means of verifying the panel's work., CONCLUSIONS: The leadership competencies will aid students in addressing: What is leadership? Who am I as a leader? What skills and abilities do I need to be effective? The competencies will help curriculum committees and leadership instructors to focus leadership development opportunities, identify learning assessments, and define program evaluation.

Y1  - 2013//
N2  - OBJECTIVE: To assist administrators and faculty members in colleges and schools of pharmacy by gathering expert opinion to frame, direct, and support investments in student leadership development., METHODS: Twenty-six leadership instructors participated in a 3-round, online, modified Delphi process to define doctor of pharmacy (PharmD) student leadership instruction. Round 1 asked open-ended questions about leadership knowledge, skills, and attitudes to begin the generation of student leadership development guiding principles and competencies. Statements were identified as guiding principles when they were perceived as foundational to the instructional approach. Round 2 grouped responses for agreement rating and comment. Group consensus with a statement as a guiding principle was set prospectively at 80%. Round 3 allowed rating and comment on guidelines, modified from feedback in round 2, that did not meet consensus. The principles were verified by identifying common contemporary leadership development approaches in the literature., RESULTS: Twelve guiding principles, related to concepts of leadership and educational philosophy, were defined and could be linked to contemporary leadership development thought. These guiding principles describe the motivation for teaching leadership, the fundamental precepts of student leadership development, and the core tenets for leadership instruction., CONCLUSIONS: Expert opinion gathered using a Delphi process resulted in guiding principles that help to address many of the fundamental questions that arise when implementing or refining leadership curricula. The principles identified are supported by common contemporary leadership development thought.

N2  - PURPOSE: The resident as teaching assistant (TA) in the operating room is an important role in the maturation of surgical trainees. One concern in the current 80-hour workweek era is that current senior residents (SRs) are unprepared to serve as TAs, potentially leading to higher complication rates and a significant increase in the length of operations. The aim of this study was to analyze whether SRs serving as TAs during laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) resulted in an adverse effect on complication rates in the 80-hour workweek era., METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted of 1668 LC performed at 2 affiliated general surgery teaching hospitals from 2003 through 2007. Teaching hospital A was a public teaching hospital where junior residents (JR) performed the LC with a scrubbed SR as TA under faculty supervision. Teaching hospital B was a community-based affiliate hospital where the JR performed LC with only scrubbed faculty supervision. Operative case duration, JR level, patient gender/age, operative indication, final pathology, and complication data were gathered and univariate and multivariate analyses were performed., RESULTS: Despite a higher rate of acute cholecystitis in the TA hospital, LC-associated complications occurred at similar rates with and without SR as TA. The rate of biliary injury was also the same in both hospitals. On multivariable analysis, only male gender was associated with complications (odds ratio = 1.7; p = 0.004)., CONCLUSIONS: In the 80-hour resident workweek era, SRs acting as TAs during LC is not associated with increased total complications or an increased rate of biliary injury.Copyright © 2013 Published by Association of Program Directors in Surgery on behalf of Association of Program Directors in Surgery.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Surgical Training and Education in Promoting Professionalism (STEPP) was developed in 2011 to train tomorrow's leaders during residency. It is based on virtue ethics and takes an approach similar to West Point military academy. The purpose of this research was: (i) to compare the virtue profiles of our residents with that of the military cohort using a standardized virtue assessment tool; and (ii) to assess the value of virtue education on residents., METHODS: As part of STEPP, otolaryngology residents participated in a virtue-based validated assessment tool called Virtue in Action (VIA) Inventory. This was completed at the initiation of STEPP in July 2011 as well as 1 year later in June 2012. Comparison of the VIA to a military cohort was performed. Leadership 'Basic Training' is a series of forums focused on virtues of initiative, integrity, responsibility, self-discipline, and accountability. A pre- and post-test was administered assessing resident perceptions of the value of this 'Basic Training'., RESULTS: Virtues are shared between otolaryngology residents (n=9) and military personnel (n=2,433) as there were no significant differences in strength scores between two military comparison groups and otolaryngology-head and neck surgery (OHNS) residents. There was a significant improvement (p<0.001) in the understanding of components of the leadership vision and a significant improvement in the understanding of key leadership concepts based on 'Basic Training'. All residents responded in the post-test that the STEPP program was valuable, up from 56%., CONCLUSIONS: A virtue-based approach is valued by residents as a part of leadership training during residency.

T1  - Sailing a safe ship: improving patient safety by enhancing the leadership skills of new consultant specialist surgeons.
A1  - Shah, Peter

A1  - Sii, Freda
Y1  - 2013//
N2  - INTRODUCTION: The potential for "discontinuities in care" arising from the turbulent transition from specialist trainee to consultant specialist presents risks to patient safety. But it is easy to lose sight of the affective needs of individuals facing the burden of keeping patients safe. This article describes a 2-day program focused on new and prospective consultant specialist ophthalmic surgeons entitled "Sailing a Safe Ship" (SASS). The purpose was to facilitate understanding and analysis of their personal holistic learning needs and enhance individual agency in optimizing learning during the transition period., METHODS: The program used gaming, team challenges, meta-planning, role play and professional actors, interactive presentations, and self-analysis tools to portray the real world of consultant specialist practice in terms of ill-defined problems requiring "elite communication" and effective negotiation of value differences and priorities for their resolution. Participants' insights into their individual learning were recorded in scheduled reflective sessions. The immediate impact on their learning was also considered in terms of direct (instructional) and indirect (nurturant) effects., RESULTS: Participants' insights reflected 4 key themes: admitting vulnerability and uncertainty, taking responsibility for managing risk, being self-aware and reflexive, and internalizing authentic leadership. Four instructional and 4 nurturant effects were revealed. Preliminary findings on long-term impact on participants' practice are outlined., DISCUSSION: Evidence from the evaluation indicated that participants felt empowered to construct a personal strategic response to unfamiliar and unanticipated workplace demands and pressures, adopt a capability mindset that would accelerate their capacity to fulfill an enhanced leadership role, and take a holistic approach to their continuing self-directed development as leaders and educators.Copyright © 2013 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education, and the Council on CME, Association for Hospital Medical Education.

Y1  - 2013//
N2  - Failures in care coordination are a reflection of larger systemic shortcomings in communication and in physician engagement in shared team leadership. Traditional medical care and medical education neither focus on nor inspire responses to the challenges of coordinating care across episodes and sites. The authors suggest that the absence of attention to gaps in the continuum of care has led physicians to attempt to function as the glue that holds the health care system together. Further, medical students and residents have little opportunity to provide feedback on care processes and rarely receive the training and support they need to assess and suggest possible improvements.The authors argue that this absence of opportunity has driven cynicism, apathy, and burnout among physicians. They support a shift in culture and medical education such that students and residents are trained and inspired to act as catalysts who initiate and expedite positive changes. To become catalyst physicians, trainees require tools to partner with patients, staff, and faculty; training in implementing change; and the perception of this work as inherent to the role of the physician.The authors recommend that medical schools consider interprofessional training to be a necessary component of medical education and that future physicians be encouraged to grow in areas outside the "purely clinical" realm. They conclude that both physician catalysts and teamwork are essential for improving care coordination, reducing apathy and burnout, and supporting optimal patient outcomes.

N2  - Doctoral education in dental hygiene is necessary to create a cadre of dental hygiene researchers and scholars, and to develop educators who will expand the body of knowledge for the profession. Dental hygienists with advanced degrees will require skill sets that parallel those of other professionals if they are to function productively as credible, equal members of interprofessional teams. Doctorally-prepared dental hygienists will be working as leaders, administrators and researchers, and will be influential in creating models that increase access to care, developing collaborative health care teams and improving health outcomes. The doctorate of philosophy is the terminal graduate degree for any discipline, and is the pinnacle for the profession. This paper explores the development of doctoral degrees for dental hygiene, and encourages educators to develop models for graduate programs based upon considerations presented here.

A1  - Sonnino, Roberta E
Y1  - 2013//
N2  - BACKGROUND: Formal leadership training is a relatively recent addition to the educational armamentarium of the health care executive. Leadership training opportunities for physicians, surgeons, and scientists have gradually appeared over the past 15 to 20 years, but information about them has been scant, with few comprehensive reviews made available to the community at large. This article describes the major opportunities available to obtain formal and informal leadership training for careers in medical school administration. Programs that are specifically targeted to women are described in detail., DATA SOURCES: Information was obtained from the author's direct knowledge, direct communication with the leadership of each program, and the Web site of each sponsoring organization, when available., CONCLUSIONS: Many opportunities for leadership training are now available to surgeons, with several specifically designed for women. The author strongly encourages surgeons to avail themselves of these opportunities, as both anecdotal information and published data suggest that these programs are highly effective in enhancing leadership careers.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Quality improvement is an important pursuit for critical care teams., DESIGN: The authors performed an observational cohort study with historic control., SETTING: Eight-bed cardiac surgery ICU in a tertiary university hospital., PARTICIPANTS: A total of 4,866 patients undergoing cardiac surgery over a 6-year period between January 2005 and December 2010., INTERVENTIONS: In this study, the influence of the introduction of a quality improvement program under the supervision of a newly appointed intensivist on patient outcomes after cardiac surgery was evaluated. Patients were further divided into three 2-year periods: Period I, 2005-2006, before appointment of an intensivist; Period II, 2007-2008, after appointment of an intensivist and initial introduction of a quality improvement program; and Period III, 2009-2010, after implementation of the program and introduction of Critical Care Information Systems., MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: There were 1,633, 1,690, and 1,543 patients in each period, respectively. There was no significant difference in the severity of patient illness between the groups. Unadjusted in-hospital mortality decreased from 6.37% (104 patients) in Period I to 4.32% (73 patients) and 3.3% (51 patients) in Periods II and III, respectively (p< 0.01)., CONCLUSIONS: Appointment of an intensivist-directed team model and introduction of quality improvement interventions were associated with decreased mortality after cardiac surgery.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - The nursing faculty shortage is directly related to the ongoing shortage of nurses. As a result of many nursing faculty retiring, the discipline of nursing is losing its most experienced educators. The need is great for programs that will increase access and prepare nurse educators. Doctorate degrees for nurses have evolved in myriad ways. Discussions over the nature of doctoral education for the preparation of nurse educators are at the forefront of debates in nursing education. In response to National League for Nursing (2007; Core competencies of nurse educators, http://www.nln.org/profdev/corecompletter.htm) and Institute of Medicine (2010; The future of nursing: Leading change, advancing health. Washington, DC: National Academies Press, http://thefutureofnursing.org/IOM-Report) calls to increase the number of nursing faculty, the colleges of nursing and education at a major university have combined to establish a collaborative doctoral program. This article describes the historical evolution of the nursing doctorate degrees and the development and implementation of the EdD in Instructional Leadership for Nurse Educators.

N2  - BACKGROUND: This study was an assessment of the professionalism curriculum at a community-based medical school from the perspective of undergraduate medical students., AIMS: The goal of this study was to ascertain the perspectives of faculty and students on their interpretations of professionalism and its role in medical education to improve and expand existing professionalism curricula., METHOD: An online survey was created and sent to all students (n = 245) and selected faculty (n = 41). The survey utilized multiple choice and open-ended questions to allow responders to provide their insights on the definition of professionalism and detail how professionalism is taught and evaluated at their institution. A content analysis was conducted to categorize open-ended responses and the resulting themes were further examined using SPSS 20.0 for Windows (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY) frequency analyses., RESULTS: Students and faculty respondents were similar in their definitions of medical professionalism and their perceptions of teaching methods. Role modeling was the most common and preferred method of professionalism education. Responses to whether evaluations of professional behavior were effective suggested both students and faculty are unclear about current professionalism assessments., CONCLUSION: This study showed that a cohesive standardized definition of professionalism is needed, as well as clearer guidelines on how professionalism is assessed.

N2  - PURPOSE: Although the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has made extensive investments in educational programs related to clinical and translational science (CTS), there has been no systematic investigation of the number and characteristics of PhD programs providing training to future leaders in CTS. The authors undertook to determine the number of institutions that, having had received NIH-funded Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSAs), currently had or were developing PhD programs in CTS; to examine differences between programs developed before and after CTSA funding; and to provide detailed characteristics of new programs., METHOD: In 2012, CTS program leaders at the 60 CTSA-funded institutions completed a cross-sectional survey focusing on four key domains related to PhD programs in CTS: program development and oversight; students; curriculum and research; and milestones., RESULTS: Twenty-two institutions had fully developed PhD programs in CTS, and 268 students were earning PhDs in this new field; 13 institutions were planning PhD programs. New programs were more likely to have fully developed PhD competencies and more likely to include students in medical school, students working only on their PhD, students working on a first doctoral degree, and students working in T1 translational research. They were less likely to include physicians and students working in clinical or T2 research., CONCLUSIONS: Although CTS PhD programs have similarities, they also vary in their characteristics and management of students. This may be due to diversity in translational science itself or to the relative infancy of CTS as a discipline.

Y1  - 2013//
N2  - The approval of the Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) by the American Association of Colleges of Nursing in 2004 and publication of The Essentials of Doctoral Education for Advanced Nursing Practice in 2006 promised significant benefit to nursing and to shaping health care systems. Currently, 229 DNP programs exist and more are planned. This article provides an overview of program types, graduates, and postgraduation placement, using Pennsylvania as an exemplar, to describe the potential impact of DNP education in health care systems. Nurse educators need to consider whether our current directions enable us to realize opportunities for shaping health care systems or whether we need to make course corrections.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Prior research has shown that surgeons who effectively manage operating room conflict engage in a problem-solving stage devoted to modifying systems that contribute to team conflict. The purpose of this study was to clarify how systems contributed to operating room team conflict and clarify what surgeons do to modify them., METHODS: Focus groups of circulating nurses and surgeons were conducted at 5 academic medical centers. Narratives describing the contributions of systems to operating room conflict and behaviors used by surgeons to address those systems were analyzed using the constant comparative approach associated with a constructivist grounded theory approach., RESULTS: Operating room team conflict was affected by 4 systems-related factors: team features, procedural-specific staff training, equipment management systems, and the administrative leadership itself. Effective systems problem solving included advocating for change based on patient safety concerns., CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study provide clarity about how systems contribute to operating room conflict and what surgeons can do to effectively modify these systems. This information is foundational material for a conflict management educational program for surgeons.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Coronary CT angiography is an effective, evidence-based strategy for evaluating acute chest pain in the emergency department for patients at low-to-intermediate risk of acute coronary syndrome. Recent multicenter trials have reported that coronary CT angiography is safe, reduces time to diagnosis, facilitates discharge, and may lower overall cost compared with routine care. Herein, we provide a 10-step approach for establishing a successful coronary CT angiography program in the emergency department. The importance of strategic planning and multidisciplinary collaboration is emphasized. Patient selection and preparation guidelines for coronary CT angiography are reviewed with straightforward protocols that can be adapted and modified to clinical sites, depending on available cardiac imaging capabilities. Technical parameters and patient-specific modifications are also highlighted to maximize the likelihood of diagnostic quality examinations. Practical suggestions for quality control, process monitoring, and standardized reporting are reviewed. Finally, the role of a "triple rule-out" protocol is featured in the context of acute chest pain evaluation in the emergency department.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Interest and participation in global health activities among U.S. medical trainees has increased sharply in recent decades, yet the global health activities of physicians who have completed residency training remain understudied. Our objectives were to assess associations between individual characteristics and patterns of post-residency global health activities across the domains of health policy, education, and research., METHODS: Cross-sectional, mixed methods national survey of 521 physicians with formal training in clinical and health services research and policy leadership. Main measures were post-residency global health activity and characteristics of this activity (location, funding, products, and perceived synergy with domestic activities)., RESULTS: Most respondents (73%) hold faculty appointments across 84 U.S. medical schools and a strong plurality (46%) are trained in internal medicine. Nearly half of all respondents (44%) reported some global health activity after residency; however, the majority of this group (73%) reported spending <=10% of professional time on global health in the past year. Among those active in global health, the majority (78%) reported receiving some funding for their global health activities, and most (83%) reported at least one scholarly, educational, or other product resulting from this work. Many respondents perceived synergies between domestic and global health activities, with 85% agreeing with the statement that their global health activities had enhanced the quality of their domestic work and increased their level of involvement with vulnerable populations, health policy advocacy, or research on the social determinants of health. Despite these perceived synergies, qualitative data from in-depth interviews revealed personal and institutional barriers to sustained global health involvement, including work-family balance and a lack of specific avenues for career development in global health., CONCLUSIONS: Post-residency global health activity is common in this diverse, multi-specialty group of physicians. Although those with global health experience describe synergies with their domestic work, the lack of established career development pathways may limit the benefits of this synergy for individuals and their institutions.

T1  - Developing a nurse residency program curricular framework.
A1  - Remillard, Amanda
Y1  - 2013//
N2  - Curricular frameworks are integral to educational programs and are viewed as the roadmaps of curriculum. This article describes the importance of curricular frameworks and the creation of an evidence-based curricular framework for a pediatric nurse residency program that had been in place for several years before framework development. The concepts of the framework include leadership, professional socialization, clinical reasoning, and technical skills. This article presents an evidence-based approach to build a curricular framework for a nurse residency program.

N2  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to identify trends and opinions with respect to leadership turnover, leadership responsibilities, and residency requirements., METHODS: Program directors (PDs) of diagnostic radiology (DR) residency programs were identified via the ACGME and the Fellowship and Residency Electronic Interactive Database, along with a programmatic website search. A web-based survey was e-mailed, with questions concerning lengths of time the current and prior PDs held their positions, residency size, amounts of time spent on and lengths of current and past Program Information Forms, and opinions on how the position has changed and how metrics, outcomes, and documentation may be affecting teaching, resident education, and patient care., RESULTS: Thirty-two percent (60 of 186) of US DR residency PDs answered at least 1 of the survey questions. The average length of time the current PDs held their positions was shorter compared with the previous PDs, and it has taken longer and required more pages to complete the current Program Information Forms compared with prior cycles. The majority of respondents felt that the job of PD was harder than 5 years ago and that turnover among PDs is a "current/impending" problem. The majority of respondents felt that time spent on metrics, outcomes, and documentation is taking away from teaching, learning, and taking care of patients., CONCLUSIONS: Many DR residency PDs have recognized increased administrative burdens in recent years. Some feel that these increased demands may in part have negative effects on resident education and patient care.Copyright © 2013 American College of Radiology. Published by Elsevier Inc.

T1  - The impact of leadership training programs on physicians in academic medical centers: a systematic review.

Y1  - 2013//
N2  - PURPOSE: To identify the impact of leadership training programs at academic medical centers (AMCs) on physicians' knowledge, skills, attitudes, behaviors, and outcomes., METHOD: In 2011, the authors conducted a systematic review of the literature, identifying relevant studies by searching electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register), scanning reference lists, and consulting experts. They deemed eligible any qualitative or quantitative study reporting on the implementation and evaluation of a leadership program for physicians in AMCs. Two independent reviewers conducted the review, screening studies, abstracting data, and assessing quality., RESULTS: The authors initially identified 2,310 citations. After the screening process, they had 11 articles describing 10 studies. Three were controlled before-and-after studies, four were before-and-after case series, and three were cross-sectional surveys. The authors did not conduct a meta-analysis because of the methodological heterogeneity across studies. Although all studies were at substantial risk of bias, the highest-quality ones showed that leadership training programs affected participants' advancement in academic rank (48% versus 21%, P=.005) and hospital leadership position (30% versus 9%, P=.008) and that participants were more successful in publishing papers (3.5 per year versus 2.1 per year, P<.001) compared with nonparticipants., CONCLUSIONS: The authors concluded that leadership programs have modest effects on outcomes important to AMCs. Given AMCs' substantial investment in these programs, rigorous evaluation of their impact is essential. High-quality studies, including qualitative research, will allow the community to identify which programs are most effective.

N2  - This report describes the implementation and evaluation of the Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center Dental Faculty Development Program (DFDP) for fifteen participants: five advanced dental education faculty members and ten residents. The 100-hour DFDP, designed in the longitudinal immersion model for faculty development, was conducted in four phases at the Bronx-Lebanon Department of Dentistry in the Bronx, New York, in 2010-11. The DFDP was implemented to help underrepresented minority (URM) dental residents and clinical faculty members develop skills necessary for academic careers and enhanced teaching effectiveness. The program's curriculum had four themes: teaching and learning, scholarship, academic leadership, and career planning. For each phase, the participants completed pre- and post-training assessments of their knowledge, attitudes, and confidence, as well as qualitative evaluation of DFDP organization, content, activities, and value. The participants' pre-instruction mean knowledge score for all phases combined was 48.3 percent, and the post-test score was 81.1 percent (p=0.01). The participants showed minimal change in their attitudes about educational issues, but they reported enhanced confidence for twenty-five skills addressed in the DFDP. The total confidence score was 77.5 (25 skills x 3.1 group mean) on all pre-tests combined and 100.2 (25 x 4.0 group mean) on the post-tests (p=0.01). The participant ratings for overall DFDP implementation and for twenty-four topical sessions were uniformly positive. The faculty and resident participants in this year-long faculty development initiative at an advanced dental education program with a high URM representation demonstrated enhanced knowledge and confidence and provided positive program evaluations. This report also describes curricular and assessment enhancements for subsequent years of the DFDP based on the first-year outcomes.

N2  - A new Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network/United Network for Organ Sharing bylaw recommends that all centers appoint a director of liver transplant anesthesia with a uniform set of criteria. We obtained survey data from the Liver Transplant Anesthesia Consortium so that we could compare existing criteria for a director in the United States with the current recommendations. The data set included responses from adult academic liver transplant programs before the new bylaw. The respondent rates were within statistical limits to exclude sampling bias. All centers had a director of liver transplant anesthesia. The criteria varied between institutions, and the data suggest that the availability of resources influenced the choice of criteria. The information suggests that the criteria used in the new bylaw reflect existing practices. The bylaw plays an important role in supporting emerging leadership roles in liver transplant anesthesia and brings greater uniformity to the directorship position.Copyright © 2013 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.

N2  - More than 20 years of teamwork, research, and experience in high-risk industries such as aviation, nuclear power, and military operations have clearly demonstrated that teamwork training and checklist usage can overcome the primary causes of adverse events. There is a growing body of evidence that checklist programs have the same error-reducing effect in operating rooms (OR) as in other industries. The benefits include documented improvements in patient safety and quality care; a better office, surgery center, or hospital in which to practice medicine; reduced exposure to malpractice risk; and increased efficiency in the OR.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The increasing medical-technical progress as well as the dramatic demographic changes cause problems with regard to rapid enlargement of medical service offers, allocation of resources and a financing shortfall in the German public health system. The economization in the German Health System can also be perceived in ENT departments., MATERIAL AND METHODS: After performing an internet search about the rapidly growing market for qualifications measures in health economics, we hence conducted an anonymous survey for ENT senior doctors and directors of the 34 German University Departments to evaluate their attitude towards, as well as their expectation of such an add-on qualification., RESULTS: Since the German government finalized the health care reform in the year 2000 such qualification measures rapidly developed: amongst others, 26 postgraduate, extra-occupational master programs have been inaugurated. The anonymous survey was answered by 105 ENT doctors (63 senior doctors, 27 vice professors and 15 directors). 63% out of these 105 colleagues considered such an add-on qualification to be mandatory. 41% of the colleagues were already "add-on qualified" in that field, only 10 of them by means of a study program. 71 of 105 colleagues (68%) considered the add-on qualification to be advantageous for their future personal career. With regard to the designated contents of the study program, "Staff Management" was even prioritized to "Hospital Financing" and "Cost Accounting"., CONCLUSION: Aspects of management and a (health-) economical basic knowledge became an integral part of the daily routine for "first-line management doctors" also in (University) ENT-departments.Copyright © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart .

Y1  - 2013//
N2  - The introduction of the Education Scholarship and Education Fellowship programmes in the Severn Deanery in 2008 was in response to an emergent need for a more formalised career structure for the most able GPSTs and specifically for identified education scholars to progress over time from a scholar to temporary and substantive training programme director (TPD) posts. As a result, two scholars have progressed to being appointed as fellows (one-year fixed-term TPDs) over the last three years and one of these is now a TPD. This qualitative research study sought to identify the value and acceptance of the scholar scheme within the Severn Deanery and in particular assess the impact of the scholar scheme in terms of educational benefits, impact on professional practice and future career opportunities. It also undertook to examine the key factors affecting the quality of experience of the scholar scheme (e.g.induction, mentorship, autonomous vs. prescribed education opportunities etc.). Findings showed unequivocal and universal support for the scheme.

T1  - Translation of the Medical Leadership Competency Framework into a multisource feedback form for doctors in training using a verbal protocol technique.
A1  - Wilkie, Veronica
A1  - Spurgeon, Peter
Y1  - 2013//
N2  - This study describes the use of think-aloud techniques to capture the reactions of doctors in training, educational supervisors and clinical directors to a draft multisource feedback (MSF) tool. The tool is based on the competencies described in the Medical Leadership Competency Framework (MLCF), which is now a part of most postgraduate medical curricula. In order to reflect properly the extent to which doctors in training have developed the appropriate competencies, the MSF needs to modify the terminology used in the MLCF. This study of 24 doctors, of whom nine were doctors in training, showed that the draft MSF tested needed to be modified in order to differentiate clearly between situations where the assessed doctor had not had adequate opportunity to demonstrate competence, and those where competence was deemed inadequate. More senior doctors tended to favour longer, more detailed MSF questionnaires, possibly reflecting their experience of how MSF can prove valuable in personal development. However, some educational supervisors found an estimated completion time of 25 minutes to be a deterrent. Five doctors from general practice, two of whom were trainees, were included in this small qualitative study, which identified a greater facility for observing and assessing leadership competency development in primary care than in hospital specialities. This finding needs to be tested in a large-scale study of a modified MSF tool.

T1  - Commentary: Recommendations and remaining questions for health care leadership training programs.
A1  - Stoller, James K
Y1  - 2013//
N2  - Effective leadership is critical for optimizing cost, access, and quality in health care. Creating a pipeline of effective health care leaders requires developing leadership competencies that differ from the usual criteria of clinical and scientific excellence by which physicians have traditionally been promoted to leadership positions. Specific competencies that differentiate effective leaders from average leaders, especially emotional intelligence and its component abilities, are essential for effective leadership.Adopting a long-standing practice from successful corporations, some health care institutions, medical societies, and business schools now offer leadership programs that address these differentiating leadership competencies. The author draws on experience with such programs through the Cleveland Clinic Academy to provide recommendations for health care leadership training and to identify unanswered questions about such programs.The author recommends that such training should be broadly available to all health care leadership communities (i.e., nurses, administrators, and physicians). A progressive curriculum, starting with foundational concepts and extending to coaching and feedback opportunities through experiential learning, recognizes the challenge of becoming an effective leader and the long time line needed to do so. Linking leadership courses to continuing medical education and to graduate credit opportunities is appealing to participants. Other recommendations focus on the importance of current leaders' involvement in nominating emerging leaders for participation, embedding leadership development discussions in faculty's professional reviews, and blending discussion of frameworks and theory with practical, experiential lessons. The author identifies questions about the benefits of formal health care leadership training that remain to be answered.

T1  - Status of anesthesiology resident research education in the United States: structured education programs increase resident research productivity.

Y1  - 2013//
N1  - Comment in: Anesth Analg. 2013 Jan;116(1):1-3; PMID: 23264170, Comment in: Anesth Analg. 2013 Jul;117(1):284; PMID: 23788742
N2  - BACKGROUND: The enhancement of resident research education has been proposed to increase the number of academic anesthesiologists with the skills and knowledge to conduct meaningful research. Program directors (PDs) of the U.S. anesthesiology residency programs were surveyed to evaluate the status of research education during residency training and to test the hypothesis that structured programs result in greater resident research productivity based on resident publications., METHODS: Survey responses were solicited from 131 anesthesiology residency PDs. Seventy-four percent of PDs responded to the survey. Questions evaluated department demographic information, the extent of faculty research activity, research resources and research funding in the department, the characteristics of resident research education and resident research productivity, departmental support for resident research, and perceived barriers to resident research education., RESULTS: Thirty-two percent of programs had a structured resident research education program. Structured programs were more likely to be curriculum based, require resident participation in a research project, and provide specific training in presentation and writing skills. Productivity expectations were similar between structured and nonstructured programs. Forty percent of structured programs had > 20% of trainees with a publication in the last 2 years compared with 14% of departments with unstructured programs (difference, 26%; 99% confidence interval [CI], 8%-51%; P = 0.01). The percentage of programs that had research rotations for >=2 months was not different between the structured and the nonstructured programs. A research rotation of >2 months did not increase the percentage of residents who had published an article within the last 2 months compared with a research rotation of <2 months (difference, 13%; 99% CI, 10%-37%; P = 0.14). There was no difference in the percentage of faculty involved in research in structured compared with unstructured research education. In programs with <20% of faculty involved in research, 15% reported >20% of residents with a publication in the last 2 years compared with 36% in programs with >20% of faculty involvement (difference, 21%; 99% CI, -4% to 46%; P = 0.03)., CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that structured residency research programs are associated with higher resident research productivity. The program duration and the fraction of faculty in resident research education did not significantly increase research productivity. Research training is an integral component of resident education, but the mandatory enhancement of resident research education will require a significant change in the culture of academic anesthesiology leadership and faculty.

Y1  - 2012//
N2  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to track the graduates of the Los Angeles College of Chiropractic (LACC) radiology residency program, review their scholarly productivity, and report those involved in teaching and leadership positions., METHODS: Former LACC residents' career information was identified through publicly available electronic documents including Web sites and social media. PubMed and the Index to Chiropractic Literature databases were searched for chiropractic graduate job surveys, and proportional comparisons were made between the career paths of LACC radiology residency graduates and those of non-residency-trained chiropractors., RESULTS: Of 47 former LACC residents, 28 (60%) have or previously had careers in tertiary (chiropractic) education; and 12 (26%) have attained a department chair position or higher at tertiary teaching institutions. Twenty-two (47%) have or previously had private radiology practices, whereas 11 (23%) have or previously had clinical chiropractic practices. Often, residency graduates hold or have held 2 of these positions at once; and one, all 3. Chapters or books were authored by 13 (28%)., CONCLUSION: Radiology residency LACC graduates are professionally active, particularly in education, and demonstrate scholarly productivity.

Y1  - 2012//
N2  - The current state of health care and its reform will require physician leaders to take on greater management responsibilities, which will require a set of organizational and leadership competencies that traditional medical education does not provide. Physician leaders can form a bridge between the clinical and administrative sides of a health-care organization, serving to further the organization's strategy for growth and success. Recognizing that the health-care industry is rapidly changing and physician leaders will play a key role in that transformation, Hartford HealthCare has established a Physician Leadership Development Institute that provides advanced leadership skills and management education to select physicians practicing within the health-care system.

N2  - CONTEXT: Power and leadership are concepts that are linked. Both are studied too infrequently in medical and health care settings, given the responsibilities and opportunities doctors and other health care personnel have to exert leadership and power appropriately to foster patient-centred and health care organisational goals., METHODS: This paper reviews Raven's concept of power, clarifies the bases of power that are available to doctors in different roles and provides illustrations of the application of the bases of power in medical practice. The relationship between power and leadership is explored, with an emphasis on how power and leadership are linked through the personal characteristics and competencies of the leader., RESULTS:   Transformational leadership illustrates the incorporation and elaboration of power strategies into a principles-driven, relationship-oriented and empirically grounded form of leadership. Illustrations of the appropriate and inappropriate use of power and leadership in health care settings are provided., CONCLUSIONS: The study of power, the study of leadership and their linkage should be incorporated to a greater degree into medical education at all levels. Strategies to achieve this end are suggested.Copyright © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2012.

N2  - OBJECTIVE To demonstrate that senior surgical residents would benefit from focused training by professionals with management expertise. Although managerial skills are recognized as necessary for the successful establishment of a surgical practice, they are not often emphasized in traditional surgical residency curricula. DESIGN Senior residents from all surgical subspecialties at McGill University were invited to participate in a 1-day management seminar. Precourse questionnaires aimed at evaluating the residents' perceptions of their own managerial knowledge and preparedness were circulated. The seminar was then given in the form of interactive lectures and case-based discussions. The questionnaires were readministered at the end of the course, along with an evaluation form. Precourse and postcourse data were compared using the Freeman-Halton extension of the Fisher exact test to determine statistical significance (P < .05). SETTING McGill University Health Centre in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. PARTICIPANTS A total of 43 senior residents. RESULTS Before the course, the majority of residents (27 of 43 [63%]) thought that management instruction only happened "from time to time" in their respective programs. After the course, 15 residents (35%) felt that management topics were "well addressed," and 19 (44%) felt that management topics have been "very well addressed" (P < .01). Residents noted a significant improvement in their ability to perform the following skills after the course: giving feedback, delegating duties, coping with stress, effective learning, and effective teaching. On the ensemble of all managerial skills combined, 26 residents (60%) rated their performance as "good" or "excellent" after the course vs only 21 (49%) before the course (P = .02). Residents also noted a statistically significant improvement in their ability to perform the managerial duties necessary for the establishment of a surgical practice. CONCLUSIONS Surgical residency programs have the responsibility of preparing their residents for leadership and managerial roles in their future careers. An annual seminar serves as a starting point that could be built on for incorporating formal management training in surgical residency curricula.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to qualitatively describe the impact of a Rapid Response Team (RRT) at a 944-bed, university-affiliated hospital., METHODS: We analysed 49 open-ended interviews with administrators, primary team attending physicians, trainees, RRT attending hospitalists, staff nurses, nurses and respiratory technicians., RESULTS: Themes elicited were categorised into the domains of (1) morale and teamwork, (2) education, (3) workload, (4) patient care, and (5) hospital administration. Positive implications beyond improved care for acutely ill patients were: increased morale and empowerment among nurses, real-time redistribution of workload for nurses (reducing neglect of non-acutely ill patients during emergencies), and immediate access to expert help. Negative implications were: increased tensions between nurses and physician teams, a burden on hospitalist RRT members, and reduced autonomy for trainees., CONCLUSIONS: The RRT provides advantages that extend well beyond a reduction in rates of transfers to intensive care units or codes but are balanced by certain disadvantages. The potential impact from these multiple sources should be evaluated to understand the utility of any RRT programme.

N2  - Health care reform calls for patient-centered medical homes built around whole person care and healing relationships. Efforts to transform primary care practices and deliver these qualities have been challenging. This study describes one Family Medicine residency's efforts to develop an adaptive leadership curriculum and use coaching as a teaching method to address this challenge. We review literature that describes a parallel between the skills underlying such care and those required for adaptive leadership. We address two questions: What is leadership? Why focus on adaptive leadership? We then present a synthesis of leadership theories as a set of process skills that lead to organization learning through effective work relationships and adaptive leadership. Four models of the learning process needed to acquire such skills are explored. Coaching is proposed as a teaching method useful for going beyond information transfer to create the experiential learning necessary to acquire the process skills. Evaluations of our efforts to date are summarized. We discuss key challenges to implementing such a curriculum and propose that teaching adaptive leadership is feasible but difficult in the current medical education and practice contexts.

N2  - Health care delivery has evolved in reaction to scientific and technological discoveries, emergent patient needs, and market forces. A current focus on patient-centered care has pointed to the need for the reallocation of resources to improve access to and delivery of efficient, cost-effective, quality care. In response to this need, primary care physicians will find themselves in a new role as team leader. The American College of Osteopathic Internists has developed the Phoenix Physician, a training program that will prepare primary care residents and practicing physicians for the changes in health care delivery and provide them with skills such as understanding the contributions of all team members (including an empowered and educated patient), evaluating and treating patients, and applying performance metrics and information technology to measure and improve patient care and satisfaction. Through the program, physicians will also develop personal leadership and communication skills.

N2  - Barriers to successful innovation can be identified and potentially addressed by exploring the perspectives of key stakeholders in the innovation process. Cardiac surgeons in Canada were surveyed for personal perspectives on biomedical innovation. Quantitative data was obtained by questionnaire and qualitative data via interviews with selected survey participants. Surgeons were asked to self-identify into 1 of 3 categories: "innovator," "early adopter," or "late adopter," and data were compared between groups. Most surgeons viewed innovation favourably and this effect was consistent irrespective of perceived level of innovativeness. Key barriers to the innovation pathway were identified: (1) support from colleagues and institutions; (2) Canada's health system; (3) sufficient investment capital; and (4) the culture of innovation within the local environment. Knowledge of the innovation process was perceived differently based on self-reported innovativeness. The majority of surgeons did not perceive themselves as having the necessary knowledge and skills to effectively translate innovative ideas to clinical practice. In general, responses indicate support for implementation of leadership and training programs focusing on the innovation process in an effort to prepare surgeons and enhance their ability to successfully innovate and translate new therapies. The perspectives of cardiac surgeons provide an intriguing portal into the challenges and opportunities for healthcare innovation in Canada.Copyright © 2012 Canadian Cardiovascular Society.

N2  - Hybrid coronary revascularization, which involves minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass surgery using the left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending and percutaneous coronary intervention using drug-eluting stents for the remaining diseased coronary vessels, is an innovative approach to decrease the morbidity of conventional surgery. Little information is available to guide hospital managers and physician leaders in implementing a hybrid revascularization program. In this article, we describe the people-process-technology issues that managers and leaders are likely to encounter as they develop a hybrid revascularization program in their practice.Copyright ©2012, Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Surgery training programs in Canada and the United States have recognized the need to modify current models of training and education. The shifting demographic of surgery trainees, lifestyle issues and an increased trend toward subspecialization are the major influences. To guide these important educational initiatives, a contemporary profile of Canadian general surgery residents and their impressions of training in Canada is required., METHODS: We developed and distributed a questionnaire to residents in each Canadian general surgery training program, and residents responded during dedicated teaching time., RESULTS: In all, 186 surveys were returned for analysis (62% response rate). The average age of Canadian general surgery residents is 30 years, 38% are women, 41% are married, 18% have dependants younger than 18 years and 41% plan to add to or start a family during residency. Most (87%) residents plan to pursue postgraduate education. On completion of training, 74% of residents plan to stay in Canada and 49% want to practice in an academic setting. Almost half (42%) of residents identify a poor balance between work and personal life during residency. Forty-seven percent of respondents have appropriate access to mentorship, whereas 37% describe suitable access to career guidance and 40% identify the availability of appropriate social supports. Just over half (54%) believe the stress level during residency is manageable., CONCLUSION: This survey provides a profile of contemporary Canadian general surgery residents. Important challenges within the residency system are identified. Program directors and chairs of surgery are encouraged to recognize these challenges and intervene where appropriate.

T1  - Commentary: getting to the next phase in medical education--a role for the vice-chair for education.

N1  - Comment on: Acad Med. 2012 Aug;87(8):1041-5; PMID: 22722351
N2  - The author argues that a particular kind of departmental leadership is needed lest medical education become hostage both to distant management through regulatory metrics (which can displace local, institutional creativity) and to the financial pressures within the institution. Departmental chairs themselves have often been seen as barriers to successful integration and redesign of medical school curricula. The vice-chair for education is a critical figure in achieving this new kind of leadership.The author describes three forms of curriculum planning and management: phase 1, where the department chair makes the decisions; phase 2, dominated by regulation from above (in part a reaction to problems with the phase 1 approach); and phase 3, the author's vision of an approach in which decisions occur within departments but with an awareness of the institution as a collaborative system, and grounded in educational theory and research. The vice-chair for education would have a key role, carrying out interdepartmental planning and assessment for the chairs, who would provide them the needed time, training (in leadership and in educational theory and practice), support (from professional educators, with advanced degrees in education), and routes to academic advancement.Responding effectively to a complex and changing environment requires senior leaders at the middle-management level (such as vice-chairs for education) who are well trained in both the content of their specialties and also in interpersonal and collaborative skills, and who have the desire to reach a common future.

T1  - Program for developing leadership in pharmacy residents.
A1  - Fuller, Patrick D
Y1  - 2012//
N2  - PURPOSE: An innovative, structured approach to incorporating leadership development activities into pharmacy residency training is described., SUMMARY: The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) has called for increased efforts to make leadership development an integral component of the training of pharmacy students and new practitioners. In 2007, The Nebraska Medical Center (TNMC) took action to systematize leadership training in its pharmacy residency programs by launching a new Leadership Development Series. Throughout the residency year, trainees at TNMC participate in a variety of activities: (1) focused group discussions of selected articles on leadership concepts written by noted leaders of the past and present, (2) a two-day offsite retreat featuring trust-building exercises and physical challenges, (3) a self-assessment designed to help residents identify and use their untapped personal strengths, (4) training on the effective application of different styles of communication and conflict resolution, and (5) education on the history and evolution of health-system pharmacy, including a review and discussion of lectures by recipients of ASHP's Harvey A. K. Whitney Award. Feedback from residents who have completed the series has been positive, with many residents indicating that it has stimulated their professional growth and helped prepared them for leadership roles., CONCLUSION: A structured Leadership Development Series exposes pharmacy residents to various leadership philosophies and principles and, through the study of Harvey A. K. Whitney Award lectures, to the thoughts of past and present pharmacy leaders. Residents develop an increased self-awareness through a resident fall retreat, a StrengthsFinder assessment, and communication and conflict-mode assessment tools.

N2  - PURPOSE: A profile of the activities and responsibilities of vice chairs for education is notably absent from the medical education literature. The authors sought to determine the demographics, roles and responsibilities, and major priorities and challenges faced by vice chairs for education., METHOD: In 2010, the authors sent a confidential, Web-based survey to all 82 identified department of medicine vice chairs for education in the United States and Canada. The authors inquired about demographics, roles, expectations of and for their position, opinions on the responsibilities outlined for their position, metrics used to evaluate their success, top priorities, and job descriptions. Analysis included creating descriptive statistics and categorizing the qualitative comments., RESULTS: Fifty-nine vice chairs for education (72%) responded. At the time of appointment, only 6 (10%) were given a job description, and only 17 (28%) had a defined job description and metrics used to evaluate their success. Only 20 (33%) had any formal budget management training, and 23 (38%) controlled an education budget. Five themes emerged regarding the responsibilities and goals of the vice chair for education: oversee educational programs; possess educational expertise; promote educational scholarship; serve in leadership activities; and, disturbingly, respondents found expectations to be vague and ill defined., CONCLUSIONS: Vice chairs for education are departmental leaders. The authors' findings and recommendations can serve as a beginning for defining educational directions and resources, building consensus, and designing an appropriate educational infrastructure for departments of medicine.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Practicing within the Halstedian model of surgical education, academic surgeons serve dual roles as physicians to their patients and educators of their trainees. Despite this significant responsibility, few surgeons receive formal training in educational theory to inform their practice. The goal of this work was to gain an understanding of how master surgeons approach teaching uncommon and highly complex operations and to determine the educational constructs that frame their teaching philosophies and approaches., DESIGN: Individuals included in the study were queried using electronically distributed open-ended, structured surveys. Responses to the surveys were analyzed and grouped using grounded theory and were examined for parallels to concepts of learning theory., SETTING: Academic teaching hospital., PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-two individuals identified as master surgeons., RESULTS: Twenty-one (95.5%) individuals responded to the survey. Two primary thematic clusters were identified: global approach to teaching (90.5% of respondents) and approach to intraoperative teaching (76.2%). Many of the emergent themes paralleled principles of transfer learning theory outlined in the psychology and education literature. Key elements included: conferring graduated responsibility (57.1%), encouraging development of a mental set (47.6%), fostering or expecting deliberate practice (42.9%), deconstructing complex tasks (38.1%), vertical transfer of information (33.3%), and identifying general principles to structure knowledge (9.5%)., CONCLUSIONS: Master surgeons employ many of the principles of learning theory when teaching uncommon and highly complex operations. The findings may hold significant implications for faculty development in surgical education.Copyright © 2012 Association of Program Directors in Surgery. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Y1  - 2012//
N2  - The Institute of Medicine (IOM) identified the need for interdisciplinary teams that collaborate, communicate, and integrate care across settings to improve health care delivery. Focusing on innovative strategies that address leadership skills in graduate nursing education could have an effect on interdisciplinary partnerships, transformation of patient care, and new styles of leadership to change current practice models. In response to the IOM guidelines, we incorporated emotional intelligence as a component in our Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) leadership curriculum. This article describes a new action-oriented leadership model that prepares the DNP graduate for leadership roles to serve the public and the nursing discipline during a time of radical changes in health care. Behavioral profile, nontraditional readings, and online discussions form the basis of the model. The principles and strategies in this article can be applied to nursing education in multiple arenas, at both the undergraduate and graduate settings.Copyright 2012, SLACK Incorporated.

Y1  - 2012//
N2  - OBJECTIVE: To examine how attending physicians and senior residents negotiated shared responsibilities for teaching and supervising on clinical work rounds., METHODS: As part of a larger ethnographic field study, we observed clinical work rounds on a General Pediatrics ward over 8 months, and interviewed 14 of 18 attending physicians and 9 of 11 senior residents whom we observed. Struck by the frequency of 2 codes in that data set ("stand back" and "step up"), we used the metaphor of a dance as an analytic strategy for understanding the dynamic relationship between attending physicians and senior residents., RESULTS: Like a traditional dance with a priori choreography, and consistent with the traditional premise in graduate medical education, attending physicians frequently "stood back" and senior residents, accordingly, "stepped up" and took on teaching and supervising responsibilities. Less often, both attending physicians and senior residents assumed the lead, or attending physicians stepped up rather than entrust senior residents. The complex clinical context sometimes changed the choreography. Attending physicians and senior residents understood their mutual responsibilities but were not bound by them; they improvised to maintain high-quality patient care., CONCLUSIONS: The metaphor of a dance enabled us to better understand not only how attending physicians and senior residents negotiate shared responsibilities for teaching and supervision on clinical work rounds, but also how the clinical context impacts this negotiation. A better understanding of this negotiated relationship may help to clarify assumptions and set realistic expectations for what it might take for senior residents to assume progressive responsibility for these responsibilities in today's clinical context.

Y1  - 2012//
N2  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to document the current state of administrative structure in US diagnostic radiology (DR) residency program leadership. A secondary objective was to assess for correlation(s), if any, with DR residency programs that equipped positions such as assistant, associate, and emeritus program director (PD) with respect to residency size and region of the country., METHODS: The Fellowship and Residency Electronic Interactive Database, as well as direct communication and programmatic Web site searches, were used to gather data regarding current US DR residency leadership. Data collected included the presence of additional leadership titles, including assistant PD, associate PD, and PD emeritus, and how many faculty members currently held each position. Programs were excluded if results could not be identified. Analysis of variance and t tests were used to estimate the correlations of the size of a residency with having additional or shared PD positions and the types of positions, respectively. Chi-square tests were used to assess for any regional differences., RESULTS: As of the time of this project, the Fellowship and Residency Electronic Interactive Database defined 186 US DR residency programs. A total of 173 programs (93%) were included in the analysis; the remainder were excluded because of unavailability of relevant data. Seventy-two percent (124 of 173) of programs had additional DR leadership positions. Of these, 30 programs (17%) had more than one such position. There were no significant differences in the sizes of the programs that used these additional positions (mean, 25 +/- 12; range, 6-72) compared with those that did not (mean, 24 +/- 12; range, 7-51). There were no significant differences between programs that had additional positions with respect to region of the country., CONCLUSIONS: The majority of US DR residency programs used some form of additional DR leadership position. In the majority of cases, this was in the form of an assistant or associate PD. Nearly one-fifth of programs studied had more than one such position. This is a positive model for the depth and breadth of management of US residency programs, serving both as a template for matrixed leadership and as a source of leadership succession planning.Copyright © 2012 American College of Radiology.

T1  - Revisiting the educationally influential physician: development of a simplified nomination form.
A1  - Karwoski, Jane Belland
Y1  - 2012//
N2  - INTRODUCTION: An educationally influential (EI) physician is one to whom colleagues look for informal clinical advice. The original nomination form created to identify EI physicians among general practitioners was published in 1978. The present research developed an updated and simplified nomination form based on a survey of specialists., METHODS: A mailed questionnaire asked specialists treating neuromuscular disease to consider traits they might look for in colleagues when seeking clinical advice and rate them on a 6-point Likert-type scale. Based on study hypotheses, the traits were categorized a priori as representing one of four categories: approachability, declarative knowledge, practice-based procedural knowledge, and translational ability. The response rate among the approximately 500 specialists surveyed was 45%., RESULTS: Practice-based procedural knowledge items were most highly rated, followed by translational ability, approachability, then declarative items. Women specialists selected a slightly different constellation of traits, including less emphasis on approachability. Performing, publishing, and even reading current research were not, on average, considered essential in an informal clinical advisor., DISCUSSION: Colleagues identified as informal clinical advisors (ICAs) by neuromuscular specialists cannot be assumed to possess knowledge of, or be practicing according to, research evidence. Participants indicated that when they made changes in their treatment of patients, they often did so on the basis of research evidence obtained in other ways, but they did not choose ICAs on the basis of their advisor's familiarity with research-based knowledge.Copyright © 2012 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education, and the Council on CME, Association for Hospital Medical Education.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education emphasizes outcome-based residency education. This project is an outcomes study on graduates of the Stanford University Integrated Plastic Surgery Residency., METHODS: A survey assessing various outcomes, including practice profile, financial, personal, and educational issues, was electronically distributed to all 130 graduates between 1966 and 2009., RESULTS: There was a 65% response rate. Nearly all respondents are currently in practice. Popular fellowships included hand and microsurgery. Most respondents participated in research and held leadership roles. Adequate residency education was noted in areas of patient care, board preparation, and ethical and legal issues. Inadequate residency education was noted in areas of managing a practice, coding, and cost-effective medicine., CONCLUSIONS: This is the first long-term outcomes study of plastic surgery graduates. Most are in active, successful practice. We have incorporated educational content related to running a small business, contract negotiating, and marketing to better prepare our residents for future practice.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to qualitatively describe the impact of a Rapid Response Team (RRT) at a 944-bed, university-affiliated hospital., METHODS: We analysed 49 open-ended interviews with administrators, primary team attending physicians, trainees, RRT attending hospitalists, staff nurses, nurses and respiratory technicians., RESULTS: Themes elicited were categorised into the domains of (1) morale and teamwork, (2) education, (3) workload, (4) patient care, and (5) hospital administration. Positive implications beyond improved care for acutely ill patients were: increased morale and empowerment among nurses, real-time redistribution of workload for nurses (reducing neglect of non-acutely ill patients during emergencies), and immediate access to expert help. Negative implications were: increased tensions between nurses and physician teams, a burden on hospitalist RRT members, and reduced autonomy for trainees., CONCLUSIONS: The RRT provides advantages that extend well beyond a reduction in rates of transfers to intensive care units or codes but are balanced by certain disadvantages. The potential impact from these multiple sources should be evaluated to understand the utility of any RRT programme.

Y1  - 2012//
N2  - All clinicians take on leadership responsibilities when delivering care. Evidence suggests that effective clinical leadership yields superior clinical outcomes. However, few residency programs systematically teach all residents how to lead, and many clinicians are inadequately prepared to meet their day-to-day clinical leadership responsibilities. The purpose of this article is twofold: first, to make the case for the need to refocus residency education around the development of outstanding "frontline" clinical leaders and, second, to provide an evidence-based framework for designing formal leadership development programs for residents. The authors first present a definition of clinical leadership and highlight evidence that effective frontline clinical leadership improves both clinical outcomes and satisfaction for patients and providers. The authors then discuss the health care "leadership gap" and describe barriers to implementing leadership development training in health care. Next, they present evidence that leaders are not just "born" but, rather, can be "made," and offer a set of best practices to facilitate the design of leadership development programs. Finally, the authors suggest approaches to mitigating barriers to implementing leadership development programs and highlight the major reasons why health care delivery organizations, residency programs, and national accreditation bodies must make comprehensive leadership education an explicit goal of residency training.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Residents and physicians frequently find themselves in leadership roles. Current residency curricula focus on the development of clinical knowledge and technical skills. A previous survey of Penn State Dermatology graduates demonstrated the perceived need and benefit of a formalized leadership curriculum in this selected group., OBJECTIVES: We sought to identify and measure the perceived need and benefit of formalized leadership training and investigate opinions regarding leadership theory from the perspective of dermatology residency program directors and chief residents nationally., METHODS: A survey containing 26 questions related to leadership theory and training were mailed to all US dermatology residency programs., RESULTS: In all, 91% of program directors and chief residents agreed that leadership skills could be taught through observation and training. A total of 78% of respondents agreed that leadership training is important during dermatology residency training. In all, 66% agreed that a formalized leadership curriculum would help residents become better resident supervisors and physicians. Only 13% reported having a formalized leadership curriculum. Participants most frequently reported learning leadership through observation and modeled behavior. A total of 15% of chief residents believed their faculty did not effectively model leadership, whereas only 2% of the program directors believed the same (P = .01)., LIMITATIONS: In all, 62% (68/109) of programs surveyed returned at least one response from the program director or chief resident. A total of 39% (42/109) had responses from both the program director and the chief resident. Because of the voluntary nature of the survey, response bias could not be excluded., CONCLUSION: Most program directors and chief residents believe leadership skills can be cultivated through observation and training. Leadership curriculum is not part of most residency programs.Copyright © 2012 American Academy of Dermatology, Inc. Published by Mosby, Inc. All rights reserved.

Y1  - 2012//
N2  - OBJECTIVES: The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education requires pediatric residency training programs to provide exposure to the prehospital management and transport of patients. The authors hypothesized that compared with a similar study a decade prior, current pediatric residency training programs have reduced requirements for participation in transport medicine, thus reducing further the opportunities for residents to learn the management of critically ill infants and children., METHODS: In 2009, a questionnaire was distributed to 182 pediatric residency program directors. The authors obtained information regarding the neonatal and pediatric transport teams, the training program size, and the pediatric residents' role in the transport team., RESULTS: Sixty-eight (37%) of the 182 surveyed institutions responded. Residents were involved in neonatal and pediatric transports in 42.8% and 55.0% of programs, respectively. When involved in transports, residents were the neonatal and pediatric team leaders 44.4% and 42.4% of the time, respectively. Evaluation of resident transport performance occurred consistently in only 23.3% (neonatal) and 21% (pediatric) of programs. Most programs (90.3%) endorsed the concept of a curriculum that would uniquely provide an integrated experience in critical care transport to increase resident exposure, competence, and confidence., CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric residency participation in neonatal and pediatric critical care transport continued to decline among training programs. Residents participating in transports were less likely to function as team leaders and frequently did not receive performance evaluations. Most respondents welcomed a curriculum that would increase residents' exposure to the critically ill infants and children transported by neonatal and pediatric teams.

T1  - Perspective: physician leaders and their bases of power: common and disparate elements.
A1  - Gabel, Stewart
Y1  - 2012//
N2  - Physicians hold numerous types of leadership positions in academic, executive, and/or clinical environments. To be successful, physician leaders must exert power, or social influence, as power is conceptualized in social psychology. The power of leaders accrues through their positions, expertise, or other factors, such as communication abilities or their ability to influence others to identify with the vision they espouse. This article discusses the types of leadership roles that physicians play and the power types they must apply in these roles. Crossing all leadership roles are a series of necessary personal characteristics and interpersonal competencies that result in what has been called "referent power," a more subtle form of social influence that is crucial for success regardless of position. Leadership training that includes practice in cultivating these personal characteristics and interpersonal competencies should be an essential component of medical and graduate medical education. Studying the types and nature of power also would be a valuable contribution to courses on professionalism in medical practice. Examples are provided of the types and uses of power that may be applied in the various leadership roles that physicians hold.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Increases in the size and number of American intensive care units have not been accompanied by a comparable increase in the critical care physician workforce, raising concerns that intensivists are becoming overburdened by workload. This is especially concerning in academic intensive care units where attending physicians must couple teaching duties with patient care., METHODS: We performed an in-person and electronic survey of the membership of the Association of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine Program Directors, soliciting information about patient workload, other hospital and medical education duties, and perceptions of the workplace and teaching environment of their intensive care units., RESULTS: Eighty-four out of a total 121 possible responses were received from program directors or their delegates, resulting in a response rate of 69%. The average daily (SD) census (as perceived by the respondents) was 18.8 +/- 8.9 patients, and average (SD) maximum service size recalled was 24.1 +/- 9.9 patients. Twenty-seven percent reported no policy setting an upper limit for the daily census. Twenty-eight percent of respondents felt the average census was "too many" and 71% felt the maximum size was "too many." The median (interquartile range) patient-to-attending physician ratio was 13 (10-16). When categorized according to this median, respondents from intensive care units with high patient/physician ratios (n = 31) perceived significantly more time constraints, more stress, and difficulties with teaching trainees than respondents with low patient/physician ratios (n = 40). The total number of non-nursing healthcare workers per patient was similar in both groups, suggesting that having more nonattending physician staff does not alleviate perceptions of overwork and stress in the attending physician., CONCLUSIONS: Academic intensive care unit physicians that direct fellowship programs frequently perceived being overburdened in the intensive care unit. Understaffing intensive care units with attending physicians may have a negative impact on teaching, patient care, and workforce stability.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Professional organizations have called for individualized training approaches, as well as for opportunities for resident scholarship, to ensure that internal medicine residents have sufficient knowledge and experience to make informed career choices., CONTEXT AND PURPOSE: To address these training issues within the University of California, San Francisco, internal medicine program, we created the Areas of Distinction (AoD) program to supplement regular clinical duties with specialized curricula designed to engage residents in clinical research, global health, health equities, medical education, molecular medicine, or physician leadership. We describe our AoD program and present this initiative's evaluation data. METHODS AND PROGRAM EVALUATION: We evaluated features of our AoD program, including program enrollment, resident satisfaction, recruitment surveys, quantity of scholarly products, and the results of our resident's certifying examination scores. Finally, we described the costs of implementing and maintaining the AoDs., RESULTS: AoD enrollment increased from 81% to 98% during the past 5 years. Both quantitative and qualitative data demonstrated a positive effect on recruitment and improved resident satisfaction with the program, and the number and breadth of scholarly presentations have increased without an adverse effect on our board certification pass rate., CONCLUSIONS: The AoD system led to favorable outcomes in the domains of resident recruitment, satisfaction, scholarship, and board performance. Our intervention showed that residents can successfully obtain clinical training while engaging in specialized education beyond the bounds of core medicine training. Nurturing these interests 5 empower residents to better shape their careers by providing earlier insight into internist roles that transcend classic internal medicine training.

T1  - Teaching strategies used by internal medicine residents on the wards.
A1  - Smith, Dustin T
A1  - Kohlwes, R Jeffrey
Y1  - 2011//
N2  - BACKGROUND: Residents serve as teachers to interns and students in most internal medicine residency programs., AIM: The purpose of our study is to explore what internal medicine residents perceive as effective teaching strategies in the inpatient setting and to formulate a guideline for preparing residents to lead their ward teams., METHODS: Housestaff identified as excellent teaching residents were recruited from a large internal medicine residency program. Focus groups were formed and interviews were conducted using open-ended questions. Transcripts of the interviews were reviewed, analyzed, and compared for accuracy by two investigators. The transcripts were then coded to categorize data into similar subjects from which recurrent themes in resident teaching were identified., RESULTS: Twenty-two residents participated in four focus group interviews held in 2008. We identified five principal themes for effective teaching by residents: (T)aking advantage of teaching opportunities, (E)mpowering learners, (A)ssuming the role of leader, (C)reating a learning environment, and (H)abituating the practice of teaching., CONCLUSION: Strategies for effective teaching by residents exist. The TEACH mnemonic is a resident-identified method of instruction. Use of this tool could enable residency programs to create instructional curricula to prepare their residents and interns to take on the roles of team leaders and teachers.

T1  - Identifying the educationally influential physician: a systematic review of approaches.
A1  - Kronberger, Matthew P
A1  - Bakken, Lori L
Y1  - 2011//
N2  - INTRODUCTION: Previous studies have indicated that educationally influential physicians' (EIPs) interactions with peers can lead to practice changes and improved patient outcomes. However, multiple approaches have been used to identify and investigate EIPs' informal or formal influence on practice, which creates study outcomes that are difficult to compare. The purposes of this systematic literature review were to (1) compare approaches used to identify EIPs and (2) identify and compare shared characteristics of EIPs as defined by the included studies., METHODS: Articles in English were obtained from PubMed, CINAHL Plus, ERIC, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Google Scholar databases, and reference lists of identified articles. Studies were compared and contrasted based on terminology, identification approach, selection criteria, and EIP characteristics according to Cresswell's 5 steps in conducting a literature review., RESULTS: Thirty-one studies met the inclusion criteria. Sociometric questionnaires and peer informants were used most frequently to identify EIPs. Multiple and varied criteria, including physician ranking, nomination by peers, percentage of nominations received, and number of votes were used by researchers to select physicians who were classified as EIPs. The identified characteristics of EIPs varied by study, with some researchers adhering to characteristics previously described by Hiss, and others adding to or deviating from those characteristics, at times based on physician specialty., CONCLUSION: Selection of an EIP identification approach requires agreement on EIPs' characteristics, consistent approaches and identification criteria, and common terms and definitions. Additional research is needed to compare characteristics of EIPs and study outcomes based on the identification method employed.Copyright © 2011 The Alliance for Continuing Medical Education, the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education, and the Council on CME, Association for Hospital Medical Education.

T1  - Attitudes of medical students to medical leadership and management: a systematic review to inform curriculum development.
A1  - Abbas, Mark R

Y1  - 2011//
N2  - BACKGROUND: There is a growing acknowledgement that doctors need to develop leadership and management competences to become more actively involved in the planning, delivery and transformation of patient services. We undertook a systematic review of what is known concerning the knowledge, skills and attitudes of medical students regarding leadership and management. Here we report the results pertaining to the attitudes of students to provide evidence to inform curriculum development in this developing field of medical education., METHODS: We searched major electronic databases and citation indexes within the disciplines of medicine, education, social science and management. We undertook hand searching of major journals, and reference and citation tracking. We accessed websites of UK medical institutions and contacted individuals working within the field., RESULTS: 26 studies were included. Most were conducted in the USA, using mainly quantitative methods. We used inductive analysis of the topics addressed by each study to identity five main content areas: Quality Improvement; Managed Care, Use of Resources and Costs; General Leadership and Management; Role of the Doctor, and Patient Safety. Students have positive attitudes to clinical practice guidelines, quality improvement techniques and multidisciplinary teamwork, but mixed attitudes to managed care, cost containment and medical error. Education interventions had variable effects on students' attitudes. Medical students perceive a need for leadership and management education but identified lack of curriculum time and disinterest in some activities as potential barriers to implementation., CONCLUSIONS: The findings from our review may reflect the relatively little emphasis given to leadership and management in medical curricula. However, students recognise a need to develop leadership and management competences. Although further work needs to be undertaken, using rigorous methods, to identify the most effective and cost-effective curriculum innovations, this review offers the only currently available summary of work examining the attitudes of students to this important area of development for future doctors.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Although enrollment of women in U.S. medical schools has increased, women remain less likely to achieve senior academic rank, lead academic departments, or be appointed to national leadership positions. The purpose of this paper is to compare the gender distribution of residency program directors (PDs) with residents and faculty in the 10 largest specialties., METHODS: The gender distribution of residents training in the 10 specialties with the largest enrollment was obtained from the annual education issue of Journal of the American Medical Association. The gender distribution of the residents was compared with the gender distribution of PDs and medical school faculty. The number of programs and the names of the PDs were identified by accessing the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education web site. Gender was confirmed through electronic search of state medical board data, program web sites, or by using internet search engines. The gender distribution of medical school faculty was determined using the Association of American Medical Colleges faculty roster database (accessed June 15, 2011). The correlation between female residents and PDs was assessed using Pearson's product-moment correlation. The gender distribution of female PDs appointed June 1, 2006, through June 1, 2010, was compared with the distribution appointed before June 1, 2006, using chi square analysis., RESULTS: Specialties with higher percentages of female PDs had a higher percentage of female residents enrolled (r=0.81, p=0.005). The number of female PDs appointed from July 1, 2006, through June 30, 2010, was greater than the number appointed before July 1, 2006, in emergency medicine (p<0.001), family medicine (p=0.02), and for all PDs (p=0.005). Female PDs were fewer than expected based on the gender distribution of medical school faculty in 7 of the 10 specialties., CONCLUSIONS: Women remain underrepresented in PD appointments relative to the proportion of female medical school faculty and female residents. Mechanisms to address gender-based barriers to advancement should be considered.

N2  - Success in academic medicine requires scientific and clinical aptitude and the ability to lead a team effectively. Although combined MD/PhD training programs invest considerably in the former, they often do not provide structured educational opportunities in leadership, especially as applied to investigative medicine. To fill a critical knowledge gap in physician-scientist training, the Vanderbilt Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP) developed a biennial two-day workshop in investigative leadership. MSTP students worked in partnership with content experts to develop a case-based curriculum and deliver the material. In its initial three offerings in 2006, 2008, and 2010, the workshop was judged by MSTP student attendees to be highly effective. The Vanderbilt MSTP Leadership Workshop offers a blueprint for collaborative student-faculty interactions in curriculum design and a new educational modality for physician-scientist training.

Y1  - 2011//
N2  - Leadership and business challenges have become increasingly present in the practice of medicine. Orthopaedic residency programs are at the forefront of educating and preparing orthopaedic surgeons. This study attempts to quantify the number of orthopaedic residency programs in the United States that include leadership or business topics in resident education program and to determine which topics are being taught and rate the importance of various leadership characteristics and business topics. A survey was sent to all orthopaedic department chairpersons and residency program directors in the United States via e-mail. The survey responses were collected using a survey collection website. The respondents rated the importance of leadership training for residents as somewhat important. The quality of character, integrity, and honesty received the highest average rating among 19 different qualities of good leaders in orthopaedics. The inclusion of business training in resident education was also rated as somewhat important. The topic of billing and coding received the highest average rating among 14 different orthopaedically relevant business topics. A variety of topics beyond the scope of clinical practice must be included in orthopaedic residency educational curricula. The decreased participation of newly trained orthopaedic surgeons in leadership positions and national and state orthopaedic organizations is concerning for the future of orthopaedic surgery. Increased inclusion of leadership and business training in resident education is important to better prepare trainees for the future.

T1  - Leadership training for radiologists: a survey of opportunities and participants in MBA and MPH programs by medical students, residents, and current chairpersons.
A1  - Baker, Stephen
A1  - Daginawala, Naznin
Y1  - 2011//
N2  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to determine opportunities for students and trainees to obtain an MPH or MBA degree during either medical school or radiology residency and to determine the prevalence of such degree possession by chairpersons in radiology., METHODS: All allopathic medical schools in the United States were surveyed to chart the number of MD/MPH and MD/MBA degree programs available to students. Program directors were contacted to assess the number of MPH or MBA courses of study administratively related to their residencies. Also, an e-mail survey was sent to all members of the Society of Chairs of Academic Radiology Departments inquiring whether each chairperson had earned an additional degree., RESULTS: Currently, 81 allopathic medical schools in the United States offer MD/MPH degrees, and 52 offer MD/MBA degrees. Six residencies provide access to MPH programs, and 3 residencies provide the opportunity to pursue an MBA in conjunction with residency. Of these, only 1 MPH program and no MBA programs had trainees enrolled at present. Twenty-six percent of the chairpersons surveyed possessed advanced degrees other than MDs., CONCLUSION: There has been rapid growth in the number of MD/MPH and MD/MBA programs available to medical students. However, there is a scarcity of similar programs accessible to trainees during or just after residency training. To assist motivated radiologists interested in leading our profession, opportunities should expand both in formal degree-granting programs and through certificate-sanctioned course series to address relevant issues of leadership and management pertinent to our specialty.Copyright © 2011 American College of Radiology.

T1  - Social accountability of medical education: aspects on global accreditation.
A1  - Lindgren, Stefan
A1  - Karle, Hans
Y1  - 2011//
N2  - Medical doctors constitute a profession which embraces trust from and accountability to society. This responsibility extends to all medical educational institutions. Social accountability of medical education means a willingness and ability to adjust to the needs of patients and health care systems both nationally and globally. But it also implies a responsibility to contribute to the development of medicine and society through fostering competence for research and improvement. Accreditation is a process by which a statutory body evaluates and recognises an educational institution and/or its programme with respect to meeting approved criteria. It is a means for quality assurance, but also a strong power to reinforce the need for improvement and reforms. It must be performed through internationally recognised and transparent standards and should foremost promote quality development. The social accountability of medical education must be included in all accreditation processes at all levels. The global standards programme by World Federation for Medical Education (WFME) provides tools for national or regional accreditation but also guidance for reforms and quality improvement. The standards are used worldwide and have been adopted to local needs in most parts of the world. They are framed to specify attainment at two levels: basic standards or minimum requirements and standards for quality development. The concept of social accountability is embedded in all parts of the WFME standards documents. In 2011, a revision of the standards for undergraduate education has been instituted. Strengthening of aspects on social accountability of medical education will be a particular concern.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Although pay-for-performance (P4P) compensation is widespread, questions have arisen about its efficacy in improving health care quality and consequences for vulnerable patients., OBJECTIVE: To assess perceptions of general internists and P4P program leaders regarding how to implement fair and effective P4P., METHODS: Qualitative investigation using in-depth interviews with P4P program leaders and focus groups with general internists., RESULTS: Internists emphasized a gradual and cautious approach to P4P implementation. They strongly recommended improving P4P measure validity and had detailed suggestions regarding how. Program leaders saw a need to implement perhaps imperfect programs but with continual improvement. Both groups advocated protecting vulnerable populations and made overlapping recommendations: improving measure validity; adjusting for patient characteristics; measuring improvements in quality (vs cutpoints); and providing incentives to physicians of vulnerable populations. Internists tended to favor explicit protections, while program leaders felt that P4P might inherently protect vulnerable patients by improving overall quality., DISCUSSION: Internists favored gradual P4P implementation, while P4P leaders saw an immediate need for implementation with iterative improvement. Both groups recommended specific measures to protect vulnerable populations such as improving measure validity, assessing improvements in quality, and providing special incentives to physicians of vulnerable populations.

N2  - PURPOSE: To compare perceptions and perspectives of medical school deans and hospital chief executive officers (CEOs) regarding roles, responsibilities, and attributes of effective clinical department chairs., METHOD: In 2009, the authors surveyed the deans of 126 U.S. medical schools and the CEOs of the primary teaching hospitals in the schools' academic health centers. All were queried on 34 items about clinical department chair performance in six categories (mission prioritization, leadership responsibilities, leadership values, skill sets, barriers to success, and competitive differentiators)., RESULTS: Eighty-four deans (67%) and 57 CEOs (45%) responded. Both groups ranked ensuring good patient care as the chair's primary responsibility; agreement between CEOs on that responsibility was much stronger than among deans (P < .01). CEOs placed greater emphasis on getting results (P < .01), whereas mentoring was a higher priority for deans (P < .01). CEOs identified the inability to work within budgeted resources as a barrier to chair success more than did deans (P < .01). CEOs reported that high-quality care and cutting-edge hospital technologies were keys to competitive distinction, whereas deans put more weight on clinical and translational research and educating future physicians. The majority of deans and CEOs rated the alignment and relationship between themselves and their counterpart as "excellent" or "good.", CONCLUSIONS: Deans and their "partner" hospital CEOs agreed on most of the attributes, skills, and responsibilities characterizing the successful clinical department chair. CEOs were biased toward patient care, clinical quality, and results, whereas deans placed more emphasis on research, education, and mentoring.

N2  - In today's society, health care systems are characterized by change, unpredictability, increasing speed of information and knowledge exchanges, redefined organizational boundaries and hierarchy, emphasis on value, teamwork, interdisciplinary collaboration, diversity, and interconnectedness. This new reality has forced nurse educators to redefine nursing leadership and prepare the Doctorate of Nursing Practice (DNP) leader through innovative courses offering experiential learning based on complex adaptive systems and quantum leadership theory. This article describes the experiential learning approach and integrated learning experience for DNP students.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Little is known about the careers of graduates of academic general pediatric (AGP) fellowship programs. We evaluated the careers of 2 cohorts of AGP fellowship graduates: an early cohort trained during 1978 to 1988, and a later cohort trained during 1989 to 1999., METHODS: We surveyed all known AGP fellowship graduates in both cohorts by using a confidential mailed survey. We assessed graduates' current professional work and analyzed curricula vitae for principal investigator (PI) grants; first-authored, peer-reviewed publications; and leadership positions., RESULTS: From the early cohort, 95 of 131 eligible graduates (73%) responded; from the later cohort, 93 of 133 (70%) responded. Two thirds of each cohort remain in academics; of these, nearly half are on tenure tracks and over half have major educational roles within their university. The percentage in the early cohort who have been PI on a research grant by 5, 10, and 15 years postfellowship was 44%, 53%, and 54%, respectively; in the later cohort, it was 62%, 75%, and 75%, respectively (P = .004 vs early cohort). During the 10 years postfellowship, the early and later cohorts averaged 5.5 and 7.4 first-authored, peer-reviewed papers, respectively (P = .4). By 10 years, a high proportion of both cohorts had become division chief (19% vs 16%), had other academic leadership positions (43% vs 59%), or were leaders in professional organizations (20% vs 30%; all P = NS)., CONCLUSIONS: Graduates of AGP fellowship programs have achieved considerable academic success. Recently trained fellows appear even more successful. The academic outcomes of these AGP fellows bode well for the future of AGP.Copyright © 2011 Academic Pediatric Association.

Y1  - 2011//
N2  - OBJECTIVE: The study's objective was to identify the important qualities of outstanding mentors as described by their mentees' letters of nomination for a prestigious lifetime achievement award in mentorship., METHODS: The Lifetime Achievement in Mentorship Award at the University of California, San Francisco, recognizes a faculty member who has demonstrated sustained mentoring excellence in the academic health sciences. Recommendation letters in support of the top 10 nominees in 2008 (n=53 letters) were analyzed using grounded theory and constant comparative technique until thematic saturation was achieved., RESULTS: In 2008, 29 faculty members (of>1000 eligible senior faculty) were nominated. Nominees were 53 to 78 years old, and 30% were women. The nominees represented 4 schools (Medicine, Nursing, Pharmacy and Dentistry) and 22 departments/divisions. Five themes emerged from the analysis. Outstanding mentors: 1) exhibit admirable personal qualitites, including enthusiasm, compassion, and selflessness; 2) act as a career guide, offering a vision but purposefully tailoring support to each mentee; 3) make strong time commitments with regular, frequent, and high-quality meetings; 4) support personal/professional balance; and 5) leave a legacy of how to be a good mentor through role modeling and instituting policies that set global expectations and standards for mentorship., CONCLUSION: This is the first study to describe the qualities of admired mentors by analyzing nomination letters for a prestigious mentoring award. Our results give new insight into how mentors foster the careers of junior faculty in the academic health sciences. The results can guide academic leaders on how to train and evaluate mentors.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - The rapidly changing field of medicine demands that future physician-leaders excel not only in clinical medicine but also in the management of complex health care enterprises. However, many physicians have become leaders "by accident," and the active cultivation of future leaders is required. Addressing this need will require multiple approaches, targeting trainees at various stages of their careers, such as degree-granting programs, residency and fellowship training, and career and leadership development programs. Here, the authors describe a first-of-its-kind graduate medical education pathway at Duke Medicine, the Management and Leadership Pathway for Residents (MLPR). This program was developed for residents with both a medical degree and management training. Created in 2009, with its first cohort enrolled in the summer of 2010, the MLPR is intended to help catalyze the emergence of a new generation of physician-leaders. The program will provide physicians-in-training with rigorous clinical exposure along with mentorship and rotational opportunities in management to accelerate the development of critical leadership and management skills in all facets of medicine, including care delivery, research, and education. To achieve this, the MLPR includes 15 to 18 months of project-based rotations under the guidance of senior leaders in many disciplines including finance, patient safety, health system operations, strategy, and others. Developing both clinical and management skill sets during graduate medical education holds the promise of engaging future leaders of health care at an early career stage, keeping more MD-MBA graduates within health care, and creating a bench of talented future physician-executives.Copyright © by the Association of American medical Colleges.

N2  - BACKGROUND: In the United States, women have attained near gender equity at the entry stages in academic medicine; however, progress has been much slower at senior leadership levels. The paucity of women leaders inhibits the ability of academic medicine to adequately meet the needs of an increasingly diverse body of students, faculty, staff, and patients. Research indicates that until a critical mass of women with sustained success as leaders is achieved, it is unlikely that this deficit will be corrected., METHODS: To promote the attainment of a critical mass of women leaders, the authors integrate two approaches to advancing women--the concept of a leadership continuum and a framework of practical approaches for moving toward gender equity at all ranks., RESULTS: An institutional guide is presented that can be used to promote dialogue about gender equity, noting areas of success and opportunities for additional improvement as well as an assessment of progress. A corresponding checklist has been developed that women faculty can use as a reflection guide for their career planning and to assess their position and progress along the leadership continuum., CONCLUSIONS: Proactive, ongoing use of these frameworks can promote reflective dialogue and provide direction and accountability for institutions working to advance women into leadership positions.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) empowers surgeons and medical centers to reliably collect, analyze, and act on clinically collected outcomes data. How individual ACS NSQIP leaders designated as Surgeon Champions (SC) utilize the ACS NSQIP at the hospital level and the obstacles they encounter are not well studied., MATERIALS AND METHODS: All SC representing the 236 hospitals participating in the ACS NSIQP were invited to complete a survey designed to assess the role of the SC, data use, continuous quality improvement (CQI) efforts, CQI culture, and financial implications., RESULTS: We received responses from 109 (46.2%) SC. The majority (72.5%) of SC were not compensated for their CQI efforts. Factors associated with demonstrable CQI efforts included longer duration of participation in the program, frequent meetings with clinical reviewers, frequent presentation of data to administration, compensation for Surgical Champion efforts and providing individual surgeons with feedback (all P < 0.05). Almost all SC stated ACS NSQIP data improved the quality of care that patients received at the hospital level (92.4%) and that the ACS NSQIP provided data that could not be obtained by other sources (95.2%). All SCs considered future funding for participation in the ACS NSQIP secure., CONCLUSIONS: Active use of ACS NSQIP data provide SC with demonstrable CQI by regularly reviewing data, having frequent interaction with clinical reviewers, and frequently sharing data with hospital administration and colleagues. SC thus play a key role in successful quality improvement at the hospital level.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Y1  - 2011//
N2  - A great deal of time and resources go into the development and training of neurosurgeons. One area that has minimal literature and assessment is leadership development. Under the core competency of interpersonal and communication skills, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education has indicated that residents are expected to work effectively as a member or leader of a healthcare team. This article reveals how a structured leadership program was developed so that residents are better prepared for the role of chief resident and future leadership roles. Beginning in October 2006, residents attended a series of 1-hour workshops conducted monthly. Topics included leadership style, conflict management, effective feedback, team building, team leadership, motivation, and moving from peer to leader. A retrospective pretest was conducted at the end of the program. Residents reported a significant knowledge gain for the majority of topics. Resident comments indicated a greater awareness of the impact of leading and ways to improve their personal leadership. Quantitatively and qualitatively, residents and faculty reported that the leadership program made a significant impact on the development of future neurosurgical leaders.

T1  - Health advocacy training: why are physicians withholding life-saving care?.
A1  - Gill, Peter J
A1  - Gill, Harbir S
Y1  - 2011//
N2  - The societal responsibility of physicians to be health advocates, both at the population and patient level is necessary to positively influence public health and policy. Physicians must commit to learn about policy reform and the legislative process. Several regulatory physician organizations emphasize the importance of health. In addition, the Association of American Medical Colleges' (AAMC) Medical Schools Objectives Project, the Medical Council of Canada Qualifying Examination objectives and several Canadian medical schools outline advocacy as an objective. As a result, several US medical schools have designed and incorporated health advocacy into their curricula. Canadian medical schools, however, have been lagging behind. To address this deficiency, the University of Alberta and the University of Calgary hosted the 1st Annual Alberta Political Action Day (PAD) to engage medical students in advocacy and the policy making process. The two-day time requirement of PAD makes it an efficient model to incorporate health advocacy into the already demanding undergraduate medical curriculum. Canadian medical schools must follow the American example and further integrate initiatives such as PAD to teach health advocacy. The skills developed will enhance student's comprehension of how they can shape health policy and truly advocate for optimal patient care.

Y1  - 2011//
N2  - Good medical leadership is vital in delivering high-quality healthcare, and yet medical career progression has traditionally seen leadership lack credence in comparison with technical and academic ability. Individual standards have varied, leading to variations in the quality of medical leadership between different organisations and, on occasions, catastrophic lapses in the standard of care provided to patients. These high-profile events, plus increasing evidence linking clinical leadership to performance of units, has led recently to more focus on leadership development for all doctors, starting earlier and continuing throughout their careers. There is also an increased drive to see doctors take on more significant leadership roles throughout the healthcare system. The achievement of these aims will require doctors to develop strong personal and professional values, a range of non-technical skills that allow them to lead across professional boundaries, and an understanding of the increasingly complex environment in which 21st century healthcare is delivered. Developing these attributes will require dedicated resources and the sophisticated application of a variety of different learning methodologies such as mentoring, coaching, action learning and networking.

N2  - BACKGROUND: This study uses the NEO-Five Factor Personality Inventory (NEO) to assess its value in identifying resident educational needs., METHODS: A cohort of surgical residents (n = 65) were administered the NEO. Statistical analysis compared the results between previously determined national norms and between varying resident demographics., RESULTS: The resident scores of Extroversion, Openness, and Conscientiousness were significantly higher than those of the US population and Agreeableness was significantly lower. By gender, only Agreeableness was statistically higher for female residents. The mean Extroversion score for residents who were postgraduate years (PGYs) 3 to 5 was significantly higher than that of PGYs 1 to 2. Further subanalyses were conducted on each primary component., CONCLUSIONS: The NEO was valuable for identifying areas where training could be especially useful to augment Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) core competencies. The use of this test on resident populations could be of significant value for tailoring comprehensive surgical leadership education programs.Copyright © 2011. Published by Elsevier Inc.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Because of the appalling health indices in West Africa, Physicians there need to be at the forefront of the organizational challenge in managing and improving health systems., AIM: To collate the views of West African surgeons on how well their educational and professional backgrounds may have prepared them for leadership and managerial roles in health care, and draw appropriate policy implications., MATERIAL AND METHODS: Filled structured questionnaires from 110 surgeons that were attending an annual conference were analyzed. The respondents' bio data, professional, educational, health administrative backgrounds were probed. Their views on justifications for physicians' involvement in health managerial roles, probable influence of some physicians' characteristic traits and professional attributes on health leadership roles, and suggestions for improvement were also collated., RESULTS: 71.8% of the respondents had held or were then holding health-related administrative posts; 90% had attended different varieties of management courses; 95.4% identified physicians as the inherent leaders of the health care team; but only 28.4% adjudged their health management role "strongly important" (28.4%) among their multi-faceted roles; and they largely agreed that some stated professional and characteristic traits of physicians tend to make them poor leaders and managers., CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the preparations that the respondents got from their formal and professional education for leadership and managerial roles in health care were not optimal. We recommend for a paradigm shift for physicians on health leadership issue which is to be facilitated by a well-focused short time duration health management course for all physicians, particularly specialists.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The past decade has seen a proliferation of leadership training programs for physicians that teach skills outside the graduate medical education curriculum., OBJECTIVE: To determine the perceived value and impact of an experiential leadership training program for pediatric chief residents on the chief residents and on their programs and institutions., METHODS: The authors conducted a retrospective study. Surveys were sent to chief residents who completed the Chief Resident Training Program (CRTP) between 1988 and 2003 and to their program directors and department chairs asking about the value of the program, its impact on leadership capabilities, as well as the effect of chief resident training on programs and institutions., RESULTS: Ninety-four percent of the chief residents and 94% of program directors and department chairs reported that the CRTP was "very" or "somewhat" relevant, and 92% of the chief residents indicated CRTP had a positive impact on their year as chief resident; and 75% responded it had a positive impact beyond residency. Areas of greatest positive impact included awareness of personality characteristics, ability to manage conflict, giving and receiving feedback, and relationships with others. Fifty-six percent of chief residents reported having held a formal leadership position since chief residency, yet only 28% reported having received additional leadership training., CONCLUSION: The study demonstrates a perceived positive impact on CRTP participants and their programs and institutions in the short and long term.

T1  - Are graduate doctors adequately prepared to manage acutely unwell patients?.
A1  - Carling, Joanne
Y1  - 2010//
N2  - BACKGROUND: Medical schools face the challenge of equipping medical graduates with the skills and knowledge required in the early detection and management of acutely unwell patients. Studies reveal that junior doctors are inadequately prepared to manage acute illness, and lack the ability to resuscitate patients in cardiac arrest. A modified programme of learning, focusing on recognition and management of the acutely ill patient and cardiac arrest, was introduced for final-year medical students at the James Cook University Hospital. Evaluating the effectiveness of the teaching was vital, as junior doctors are often the first responders to deteriorating patients who require prompt life-saving interventions., METHODS: This qualitative study involved interviewing a purposive sample of graduate doctors following 4 months of acute clinical experience. The study explored their encounters of acute illness and their levels of preparedness to manage such patients within the clinical environment upon qualifying. Content-thematic analysis was utilised to examine interview data., RESULTS: Although anxious, participants expressed that they were adequately prepared to manage the acutely unwell patient and cardiac arrest upon qualifying. The programme of learning proved effective in providing learning experiences, mainly through clinical simulation, the use of the ABCDE (airway, breathing, circulation, disability, exposure) structured approach, and the Immediate Life Support course (Resuscitation Council, UK), and in equipping graduate doctors with the knowledge and skills required to manage critically ill patients., DISCUSSION: In essence, clinical tutors are indirectly responsible for saving patients lives. Evaluating the effectiveness of acute illness teaching is essential, as this ultimately will impact on patient outcome and survival.Copyright © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2010.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Effective physician leadership is critical to the future success of healthcare organizations. The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) Leadership Fellows Program is a one-year program designed to train young orthopaedic surgeons to become future leaders in orthopaedics. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of the AAOS Leadership Fellows Program on the leadership skills and achievements of its participants., METHODS: Graduates of the Leadership Fellows Program were compared with a control group of previous applicants who were not accepted to the program (applicants) in a retrospective cohort comparison study. A subjective survey of leadership skills was used to assess the confidence of the two cohorts in eight areas of leadership. In addition, an updated curriculum vitae from each of sixty leadership fellows from the classes of 2003 through 2009 and from each of forty-seven applicants was retrospectively reviewed for evidence of leadership. The updated curriculum vitae of the leadership fellows was evaluated for leadership activity attained prior to and following participation in the program, while the updated curriculum vitae of applicants was evaluated for leadership activity attained prior to and following the last year of application to the program. Curricula vitae were assessed for demonstration of national leadership, academic rank, hospital administrative rank, and research experience., RESULTS: On the leadership survey, the graduates of the Leadership Fellows Program scored higher than the applicants in seven of eight categories. The review of the curricula vitae demonstrated that, prior to the Leadership Fellows Program, the leadership fellows were more likely than the applicants to have an academic practice and hold an academic rank. The difference between the two cohorts in administrative rank and leadership of national committees was not significant. Following the program, the leadership fellows were more likely to chair national committees (p < 0.001) and hold leadership positions in their hospitals (p = 0.008). Furthermore, the leadership fellows were more likely to advance in their academic and administrative ranks compared with those who applied to the program and were not accepted., CONCLUSIONS: The AAOS Leadership Fellows Program seems to have a positive impact on the leadership competency of its participants. Graduates of the program are more likely to assume leadership positions in national organizations and within their own institutions.

N2  - The expansion of U.S. doctoral nursing research programs and transitions based on demographic distribution of the nursing academic workforce raises questions about the preparation for leadership transition planning. The purpose of this study was to describe the program leaders, job conditions, and status of transition efforts. A survey of U.S. nursing research doctoral programs (N = 105) was conducted in 2008. The response rate was 84.8%. A Web search of nonresponding schools provided some data from all programs. Most research doctoral program leaders hold additional responsibilities (mean = 4.2). The mean budgeted leadership time was 32.9% (SD = 21.4). Among programs in which the director's age was at least 60 years, 59% had no succession plan. Continuing improvement of the quality of doctoral nursing research programs could be compromised by leadership transition issues. To produce research-competitive graduates, continued support and attention to leadership of these programs is essential.Copyright 2010, SLACK Incorporated.

N2  - Physician-leaders are needed to address the widening gap in health disparities in an increasingly complex health care system. To be effective leaders, physicians need specific training; yet despite its importance, leadership training is rarely addressed during graduate medical education. As a result, most physician leadership training occurs after residency training. To address this gap in medical education, in 2004 the authors developed the Pediatric Leadership for the Underserved (PLUS) program at the University of California, San Francisco. The PLUS program incorporates leadership development into the framework of standard clinical training by providing specific sessions in personal leadership development and in related skills such as team building, negotiation, and conflict management. Leadership training is explicitly tied to clinical experiences to maximize relevance and opportunities for "real-time" application of new skills and knowledge. In addition, the curriculum includes sessions to develop and implement a three-year longitudinal child health project. Trainees are organized into advising groups to provide structured faculty and peer-peer advising. Key lessons learned in the implementation include the importance of having a skill-based, rather than a topic-based curriculum, and of exposing trainees to concrete examples of the many career paths of physician-leaders. Early outcomes from 2004 to 2009 include program evaluation data, trainee accomplishments, and postgraduate careers. This paper aims to inform other training programs about the development and feasibility of a residency program that incorporates leadership and underserved medicine curricula into the framework of standard clinical training.

N2  - BACKGROUND: One of the goals of plastic surgery residency programs is to provide effective training in aesthetic surgery. Recently, programs have adopted the idea of chief clinics to provide senior residents with the opportunity to perform cosmetic surgery with an increased level of autonomy. The goal of this article is to characterize chief clinics currently in place and their usefulness in providing effective training in plastic surgery under the precepts set forth by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education., METHODS: A survey was created focusing on six broad categories: respondent identifier, clinic structure, clinic monetary earnings, patient demographics, procedures, and educational utility. Surveys were distributed to all plastic surgery residency programs targeting current and recently graduated chief residents, and program directors., RESULTS: A total of 123 surveys were returned. Eighty of the 88 plastic surgery residency programs (91 percent) were represented. Of the programs responding, 71.3 percent (57 programs) had a chief resident clinic. Thirty-two of the respondents (43.8 percent) reported that 100 percent of the procedures performed were cosmetic in nature. Programs differed widely on their frequency of occurrence and support staff available. A majority of respondents felt these clinics enhanced resident understanding of the six Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education core competencies., CONCLUSIONS: A majority of plastic surgery training programs use the chief clinic model to enhance resident education. These clinics vary in makeup and case distribution but serve as an effective way of teaching autonomy, surgical maturity, and the six Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education core competencies.

N2  - A private hospital company has the same criteria for leading surgeons as all other healthcare providers. The main criteria are medical competency and good manners with patients and medical staff. Economical knowledge is also very important but does not necessarily include a special qualification in business administration, such as MBA. The head of a surgical department must be able to include current developments in health policy into the work. He should also be able to analyze his own situation and make corrections if possible and discuss the current economical situation in a constructive and trustworthy manner with the management. The head of a surgical department is responsible for the quality of medical and surgical education of his staff.

Y1  - 2010//
N2  - Professional training courses are a matter of course for any surgeon who wants to offer the best and most up-to-date treatment to patients. But after leaving the operating room surgeons will be confronted with issues that demand more than surgical skills. As a leader of a team the expectations and needs of the people under his care and of the managers above him need to be faced. Leadership seminars are an opportunity to become aware of these and to learn how to competently react to them. They can offer support on many levels: what type of leader am I? How do I appear to others? What do my employees/superiors expect from me? How can I manage my staff, not least in terms of reaching the goals of my department or the company? Which leadership tools are there and how can I use them? Good leadership seminars can be recognized by the balance of different aspects which they cover: they offer new expertise as well as opportunities for reflecting on one's personality and everyday work and introduce new approaches with an immediate opportunity for practicing them effectively. The key is that managers monitor their progress continuously and ideally continue to develop themselves further throughout their working life.

N2  - BACKGROUND: National Resident Matching Program (NRMP) policy outlines the conduct expected by both program directors and residency applicants. However, recent studies and personal experiences have introduced the possibility that NRMP policy is violated during the residency application process., OBJECTIVE: To investigate the communications that occur between dermatology applicants and dermatology programs during the residency application process., METHODS: From April to July 2009, we surveyed 2009 Stanford dermatology applicants, current US dermatology residents, and US dermatology program directors. The survey was anonymous and available online. The main outcome measures were the frequency and incidence of dermatology NRMP policy violations., RESULTS: Thirty-one percent of Stanford applicants and 19% of US dermatology residents felt pressured to reveal to programs how they ranked them before match day. Seventeen percent of Stanford applicants and 14% of US dermatology residents witnessed behavior that made them feel uncomfortable or that they thought was a possible ethical infraction of NRMP policy., LIMITATIONS: Response rates were as follows: 43% of Stanford applicants, 46% of residents, and 61% of program directors., CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that some dermatology program directors violate NRMP policy during their communications with applicants. The most widespread violation is pressuring applicants into revealing how they intend to rank programs. Other violations include apparent sexual discrimination and reserving NRMP positions for preselected applicants. Additional studies should be done in order to determine the incidence of dermatology applicants violating NRMP policy.Copyright © 2010 American Academy of Dermatology, Inc. Published by Mosby, Inc.

N2  - To achieve care integration required for efficient high-quality care, physicians are increasingly organized into large multispecialty groups. The success of these groups depends in large part on the ability of leadership to successfully navigate the shifting reimbursement, regulatory, and quality and safety terrain, while simultaneously providing their physicians with a rewarding practice environment. The knowledge and management tools required for such leadership are not taught in medical school or residency and are rarely acquired as a product of day-to-day physician activities. In an effort to meet these challenges, the Massachusetts General Physicians Organization created a leadership development program. This article details the development, implementation, and experience of the program.

Y1  - 2010//
N2  - OBJECTIVES: Resuscitation of the acutely ill child is a necessary skill for pediatric residents. The effects of a hospital-wide mock code program on involvement, anxiety, and leadership have not been studied. We hypothesized that after 1 year of mock codes, pediatric residents would report (1) increased participation, (2) decreased anxiety and increased comfort with knowledge, and (3) increased likelihood of leading and feeling capable of running a code., METHODS: In this cross-sectional study of pediatric residents, anonymous surveys evaluated involvement, comfort, and leadership in codes before and 1 year after a monthly mock code curriculum was incorporated into the resident educational curriculum. The survey measured residents' involvement in actual and mock codes and levels of anxiety, knowledge, and leadership ability during codes., RESULTS: Approximately 60 residents returned completed survey forms each year. Attendance and participation at actual codes were not significantly changed between years. For mock codes, there was a significant change (P < 0.001) in both observation and participation. After 1 year, residents reported a statistically significant increase in their comfort with knowledge during a code (odds ratio, 2.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-5.2). They also reported a decrease in anxiety and felt more capable of running a code, although these numbers were not statistically significant., CONCLUSIONS: One year after starting a mock code program, residents attended more mock codes and reported more comfort with knowledge in codes. A continued monthly mock code program will provide residents with critical skills training and experience and may translate into active participation, increased leadership, and decreased anxiety in actual codes.

Y1  - 2010//
N2  - The 3 fundamental and essential responsibilities of leadership--setting a compelling and appealing direction (vision), selecting the right people (talent), and creating and embracing the right set of guiding core values (culture)--are reviewed in the context of the many contributions and leadership legacy of Dr Stanley J. Dudrick, one of the giants of American surgery. Critical success factors which enable the development of leadership as an organizational capacity in any department or unit are emphasized. They include building a team of faculty and residents who are aligned on mission, vision, and values; forging a climate where people are willing to have difficult conversations rather than avoiding complex problems; and the establishment of an esprit d'corps where people experience that they are contributing to a purpose larger than themselves.

N2  - Medical professionals with additional economic qualifications are in high demand. For doctors who aim for leading positions at medical institutions the most popular additional qualification is a Master of Business Administration (MBA). The demands on executive managers in hospitals have without any doubt changed in recent years requiring them to be trained in basic economic understanding, human resource management etc. in addition to having excellent medical training. However, MBA programs differ from one academic institution to the next. Due to the lack of standardized schedules in MBA programs it cannot be ascertained whether a candidate received adequate training and can offer the skills necessary for a higher level medical profession. In this paper the author suggests that specific training in individually required skills would be more reasonable and effective rather than encouraging medical staff to pursue academic studies leading to an MBA.

N2  - The present day and future requirement profiles for leading surgeons have become manifold and are defined as such. Many requirements are teachable and learnable, such as economy and management. It is more difficult to form a leading personality out of a capable surgeon and can only succeed if the personal character disposition is already present. Only such personalities will be able to remain authentic as leader of a clinic. Success is based as always on a symbiosis of the learnable basics and the personality structure with the willingness to lead and to serve and not to become tired of it.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Community health centers are facing a shortage of primary care physicians at a time when government plans have called for an expansion of community health center programs. To succeed with this expansion, community health centers require additional well-trained physician leadership. Our objective was to ascertain how medical directors obtain leadership skills in an attempt to identify the best methods and venues for providing future leadership training programs., METHODS: Using recorded interviews and focus group data with community health center medical directors, we identified patterns and themes through cross-case content analysis to determine leadership training needs in underserved settings., RESULTS: Medical directors often enter positions unprepared and can quickly become frustrated by an inability to make system improvements. Medical directors seek multiple ways to obtain the leadership skills necessary, including conferences, peer networking, mentorship, and formal degree training. Many directors express a desire for additional training, preferring flexibility in curriculum and hands-on components., CONCLUSIONS: Additional leadership training opportunities for active and future medical directors are needed. Academic medical centers and other training sponsors should consider innovative ways to develop effective physician leadership to provide quality care to underserved communities.

T1  - Commentary: doctors without boundaries: the ethics of teacher-student relationships in academic medicine.
A1  - Larkin, Gregory Luke

Y1  - 2010//
N2  - Possessed of both instinct and intellect, physician teachers are required to be respectful exemplars of professionalism and interpersonal ethics in all environments, be it the hospital, classroom, or outside the educational setting. Sometimes, even while protecting the sanctity of the teacher-student relationship, they may surreptitiously find themselves in the throes of consensual intimacy, boundary violations, student exploitation, or other negative interpersonal and/or departmental dynamics. One may question how an academic can consistently resolve this tension and summon the temperance, humility, charity, and restraint needed to subdue lust, pride, abuse, and incontinence in the workplace. One important answer may lie in an improved understanding of the moral necessity of social cooperation, fairness, reciprocity, and respect that is constitutive of the physician-teacher role. Although normative expectations and duties have been outlined in extant codes of ethics and conduct within academic medicine, to date, few training programs currently teach faculty and residents about the ethics of appropriate pedagogic and intimate relations between teaching staff and students, interns, residents, researchers, and other trainees. This essay highlights examples from history, literature, and medical ethics as one small step toward filling this void.

Y1  - 2010//
N2  - AIM: The present study reports preliminary findings regarding new graduate nurses participating in a year-long local residency programme at two hospitals in Las Vegas, NV., BACKGROUND: Nurse resident programmes are purported to increase the level of clinical competency and professional transition in new graduate registered nurses (RNs) and to decrease first-year turnover rates. The effectiveness of this programme was assessed using data of the first two cohorts participating in this new residency programme., METHOD: Clinical competencies, anxiety, stress, professional transition and retention were measured on 55 nurse residents who have participated in the nurse residency programme., RESULTS: The findings indicate improved clinical competency throughout the programme, a decreased sense of threat, and improved communication and leadership skills. The first-year cohort's employment retention rate was 78%, and the second-year cohort is presently 96%., CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study demonstrate the positive impact of a year-round residency programme for new graduate RNs. Implications for nursing management The need for a consistent nurse workforce demands that new graduates be transitioned into competent practitioners as soon as possible. Nurse residency programmes can provide this support and decrease replacement costs involved in high turnover.

N2  - Despite the growing prevalence and healthcare needs of people living with mental illness, the stigma associated with mental health nursing continues to present challenges to recruiting new nurses to this sector. As a key recruitment strategy, five mental health hospitals and three educational institutions collaborated to develop and pilot an innovative nursing residency program. The purpose of the Mental Health Nursing Residency Program was to dispel myths associated with practising in the sector by promoting mental health as a vibrant specialty and offering a unique opportunity to gain specialized competencies. The program curriculum combines protected clinical time, collaborative learning and mentored clinical practice. Evaluation results show significant benefits to clinical practice and an improved ability to recruit and retain nurses. Nursing leadership was crucial at multiple levels for success. In this paper, we describe our journey in designing and implementing a nursing residency program for other nurse leaders interested in providing a similar program to build on our experience.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Training partnerships between family medicine residencies (FMRs) and community health centers (CHCs) are a potential solution to the chronic problem of health workforce shortages in CHCs. We conducted a national survey to identify the barriers to training family medicine residents in CHCs., METHODS: We asked US family medicine residency directors to identify barriers to training residents in CHCs. Using grounded theory, three coders grouped responses by theme. We examined differences in barriers between residency programs that currently train in CHCs with programs that do not currently train in CHCs., RESULTS: A total of 51% (226/439) of residency program directors responded. Of these, 29% cited governance as a barrier to affiliation, 26% cited administrative complexity, 24% cited financial considerations, 21% cited leadership, and 18% cited access. Programs that trained in CHCs were more likely to cite financial considerations and administrative complexity than programs that did not train in CHCs., CONCLUSIONS: Governance and administrative complexity are the most commonly cited barriers to effective CHC-FMR partnerships. Financial consideration and leadership issues are also common barriers.

N2  - The expansion of US doctoral research programs raises questions about mentorship capacity, program quality, and decisions about future expansion. To describe capacity issues and, when possible, compare findings to those of an earlier study, a survey of US nursing research doctoral programs (n = 105) was conducted in 2008. The response rate was 84.8%. The Web sites of non-responding schools were reviewed providing some data from all programs. The mean ratio of students per current externally funded grant was 6.9 (SD 7.5) to 1. The mean ratio of student to ever-funded faculty was 8.3 (SD 8.3) to 1. The mean number of research activities required (out of 5 possible) was 1.8 (SD 1.4), and the most common was a research practica (77%), followed by attendance at a research meeting external to the school (37%), and submitting an article for publication (32%). The quality of many programs may be compromised by capacity issues. Attention to existing programs' requirements and capacities and determination of the roles of these variables in producing research competitive graduates is needed.Copyright 2010 Mosby, Inc.

N2  - Many medical authors and organizations have called for physician advocacy as a core component of medical professionalism. Despite widespread acceptance of advocacy as a professional obligation, the concept remains problematic within the profession of medicine because it remains undefined in concept, scope, and practice. If advocacy is to be a professional imperative, then medical schools and graduate education programs must deliberately train physicians as advocates. Accrediting bodies must clearly define advocacy competencies, and all physicians must meet them at some basic level. Sustaining and fostering physician advocacy will require modest changes to both undergraduate and graduate medical education. Developing advocacy training and practice opportunities for practicing physicians will also be necessary. In this article, as first steps toward building a model for competency-based physician advocacy training and delineating physician advocacy in common practice, the authors propose a definition and, using the biographies of actual physician advocates, describe the spectrum of physician advocacy.

T1  - Commentary: Mentoring the mentor: executive coaching for clinical departmental executive officers.

N2  - Departmental executive officers (DEOs), department chairs, and department heads in medical schools are often hired on the basis of their accomplishments in research as well as their skills in administration, management, and leadership. These individuals are also expected to be expert in multiple areas, including negotiation, finance and budgeting, mentoring, and personnel management. At the same time, they are expected to maintain and perhaps even enhance their personal academic standing for the purposes of raising the level of departmental and institutional prestige and for recruiting the next generation of physicians and scientists. In the corporate world, employers understand the importance of training new leaders in requisite skill enhancement that will lead to success in their new positions. These individuals are often provided with extensive executive training to develop the necessary competencies to make them successful leaders. Among the tools employed for this purpose are the use of personal coaches or executive training courses. The authors propose that the use of executive coaching in academic medicine may be of benefit for new DEOs. Experience using an executive coach suggests that this was a valuable growth experience for new leaders in the institution.

T1  - Expanding the vision: the strengths-based, community-oriented child and adolescent psychiatrist working in schools.

Y1  - 2010//
N2  - Because the majority of children with mental health needs are most likely to receive treatment in a school setting, there is a long history of linking child and adolescent psychiatrists to schools. Psychiatrists traditionally have been involved in assessing, diagnosing, and treating the severely mentally ill or consulting with school-based providers. With no end in sight to the dearth of child and adolescent psychiatrists, not to mention child and adolescent behavioral health providers in other disciplines, this role has been broadened in recent years by several programs in which the child and adolescent psychiatrist provides flexible, population-based, systemic, and context-specific approaches to working in schools. In this article, the authors first review some of the traditional roles for child and adolescent psychiatrists working in school mental health settings. Then 2 national programs are highlighted, which successfully integrate psychiatrist trainees into comprehensive school mental health programs. The theoretical approach to a specific community-oriented, strengths-based model for school mental health support used in New Mexico by the University of New Mexico (UNM) Psychiatry Department's Center for Rural and Community Behavioral Health school telepsychiatry program, which supports rural and frontier school mental health programs and school-based health centers, is discussed in detail. The UNM model involves a strength-and resiliency-based collaboration between the child and adolescent psychiatrist, students, families, educators, and those who support them. The psychiatrist co-creates a "community of concern" and support for students, including not only customary participants such as parents, educators, and health care providers but also peers, families of choice, lay professionals, community gatekeepers, and others identified by the student as critical to his or her well-being. The advantages for child and adolescent psychiatry trainees being exposed to a wider variety of potential roles working with schools are also discussed.

T1  - Directing child and adolescent psychiatry training for residents.
A1  - Sexson, Sandra B
Y1  - 2010//
N2  - Directing child and adolescent psychiatry (CAP) training for residents is a complex and challenging administrative task that encompasses the broad creativity of the orchestral conductor, the social and interpersonal effectiveness of the best politician, and the orientation to details of the finest accountant. This article examines these roles in detail, recognizing the leadership, administrative, and managerial achievements of the successful child and adolescent program director. Resources for optimizing the chances for success in each of these areas, and the common pitfalls to avoid, are identified and discussed. The article concludes with suggestions for CAP training directors to influence medical student education. Although challenging and sometimes frustrating, the role of the program director in CAP training is almost always exciting and rewarding.

N2  - Inpatient child and adolescent psychiatry leadership roles are often multifaceted, necessitating strong clinical knowledge and skills, organizational and leadership abilities, and in the academic setting the desire and skill in teaching and research. Early career psychiatrists who do possess these attributes may find themselves unprepared for such challenges as dealing with complex administrative and economic issues, accreditation, legal matters, and multitasking. This article offers a primer addressing these basic issues and in managing change through quality improvement processes.

N2  - PURPOSE: All residency programs must comply with the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) work-hour guidelines, but compliance requires accurate interpretation of the rules. We previously surveyed the residents and program directors of general surgery residency programs and found significant discordance between what program directors and residents considered violations. Our current study expands our research to include family medicine and emergency medicine residents and program directors. This study aims to identify discrepancies of work-hour guideline interpretation within and between the specialties., METHODS: We created 10 scenarios related to work-hour issues. The ACGME reviewed them and judged whether a violation occurred in each scenario. From these scenarios, an Internet-based survey was generated and distributed electronically to every family medicine and emergency medicine residency in the United States. (Surgery programs were previously surveyed from March 1 through May 21, 2007 with the same scenarios.) Responses were collected anonymously via our Internet-based survey database from March 1 through May 17, 2008. All respondents were asked to identify themselves as either a program director or a resident. After reading each scenario, participants were asked to answer either "yes," "no," or "maybe/not sure." The option of "maybe/not sure" was in place to discourage guessing; those responses were not included in our analysis. After the data were collected, we calculated the percent of respondents that answered "yes" or "no" for each of the 10 scenarios related to work-hour issues. The results from within specialties (program directors vs residents) and between specialties (general surgery, family medicine, emergency medicine) were compared., RESULTS: There were a total of 883 respondents (334 general surgery, 374 family medicine, and 175 emergency medicine). Respondents identified themselves as program directors (97), assistant program directors (21), or residents (765). Statistically significant differences were identified in the responses of program directors and residents within and between specialties., CONCLUSIONS: Based on the scenarios we presented, there was a difference in interpretation between residents and program directors. There was even disagreement among program directors of different specialties on the interpretation of some of the scenarios. This finding reveals an ambiguity in the work-hour restrictions. We conclude that the ACGME-mandated work-hour guidelines are confusing and not universally understood. This problem is compounded by the cross-training with "off-service" residents from other specialties such as family medicine and emergency medicine. Hence, enforcement of the work-hour restrictions may be problematic, despite the best intentions and sincere effort of directors and residents to interpret the rules.

T1  - Toward clarification of the doctor of nursing practice degree.
A1  - Chism, Lisa Astalos
Y1  - 2009//
N2  - The doctor of nursing practice (DNP) degree has been recommended by the American Association of College of Nursing (AACN) as the terminal degree in nursing practice by 2015 (AACN, 2004). However, confusion regarding this degree still exists. To promote understanding of this degree, the pertinent history of doctoral education in nursing is reviewed. In addition, a clear definition of the degree, including the competencies of the DNP degree, is provided. A comparison of the PhD in nursing and the DNP degree is also reviewed to provide further clarification. DNP graduates may engage in various roles such as leadership, health policy advocate, and scholarship. These roles will be reviewed as well as the relevant issues associated with this degree such as use of the title "Dr.," educating others about the degree, faculty shortages, and program enrollment. Finally, the implications for emergency nursing regarding the DNP degree are discussed.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Leadership courses and multi-source feedback are widely used developmental tools for leaders in health care. On this background we aimed to study the additional effect of a leadership course following a multi-source feedback procedure compared to multi-source feedback alone especially regarding development of leadership skills over time., METHODS: Study participants were consultants responsible for postgraduate medical education at clinical departments., STUDY DESIGN: pre-post measures with an intervention and control group. The intervention was participation in a seven-day leadership course. Scores of multi-source feedback from the consultants responsible for education and respondents (heads of department, consultants and doctors in specialist training) were collected before and one year after the intervention and analysed using Mann-Whitney's U-test and Multivariate analysis of variances., RESULTS: There were no differences in multi-source feedback scores at one year follow up compared to baseline measurements, either in the intervention or in the control group (p = 0.149)., CONCLUSION: The study indicates that a leadership course following a MSF procedure compared to MSF alone does not improve leadership skills of consultants responsible for education in clinical departments. Developing leadership skills takes time and the time frame of one year might have been too short to show improvement in leadership skills of consultants responsible for education. Further studies are needed to investigate if other combination of initiatives to develop leadership might have more impact in the clinical setting.

N2  - PURPOSE: Residents are being asked to participate in quality improvement (QI) initiatives in hospitals and clinics with increasing frequency; however, the effectiveness of improving patient care through residents' participation in QI initiatives is unknown., METHOD: A thorough, systematic review of the English-language medical literature published between 1987 and October 2008 was performed to identify clinical QI initiatives in which there was active engagement of residents. Multiple search strategies were employed using PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, and ERIC. Articles were excluded in which residents played a passive or peripheral role in the QI initiative., RESULTS: Twenty-eight articles were identified that documented residents' active leadership, development, or participation in a clinical QI initiative, such as curriculum change, clinical guideline implementation, or involvement with a clinical QI team. The role and participation of residents varied widely. Measures of patient health are described as outcomes in the QI initiatives of 5 of the 28 articles. Twenty-three articles described process improvements in patient care or residents' education as the outcome measure., CONCLUSION: There are few articles that describe the clinical or educational effectiveness of residents' participation in QI efforts; the authors describe barriers that may be partly responsible. They conclude that there is a great need for additional research on the effectiveness of residents' participation in QI initiatives, particularly as they affect patient health outcomes.

N2  - Active engagement of both the designated institutional official (DIO) and the program director (PD) is essential to implement any change in graduate medical education (GME). Strategies that are established by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education or other entities are, in the end, effective only as implemented at the individual program level. The interpretation of national standards or guidelines, and the specific adaptation to the vagaries of individual institutions and programs, can lead to significant variability in implementation and potentially in outcomes. Variability occurs between programs within the same institution and between some specialty programs at different institutions. The National Initiative, sponsored by the Alliance of Independent Academic Medical Centers, was launched in 2007 to demonstrate the effectiveness of GME as a key driver to improve quality, patient safety, and cost-effectiveness of care. This report addresses (1) the key roles of both the DIO and the PD in achieving the goals of the National Initiative, (2) the challenges these goals presented to each role, and (3) some of the tactics drawn from the experiences of the National Initiative in overcoming those challenges. The experience of the National Initiative underscored the synergies of the DIO and PD roles to improve patient care while simultaneously fulfilling their critical responsibilities as institutional and program leaders in GME with even greater effectiveness.

T1  - Perspective: Educating physicians to lead hospitals.

Y1  - 2009//
N1  - Comment in: Acad Med. 2012 May;87(5):549-50; author reply 550, 550; PMID: 22531581
N2  - The percentage of hospitals that are physician led has been steadily declining and now stands at or near an all-time low. What price do the health care system and the people it serves pay for this decline in physician leadership? What might health care look like if medical educators devoted more time and attention to developing future physicians as organizational leaders? What changes would medical schools need to make to prepare medical students to play such a role? What advantages might accrue for patients, communities, and physicians themselves if more hospitals were physician led? Because hospitals are a vital resource in caring for the sick, promoting health, and addressing the challenges facing the U.S. health care system, it is now more important than ever before to explore how medical education can complement its traditional focus on the molecular, cellular, and organismal levels of health and disease with insight into the organizational dimensions of patient care. The authors believe the time is ripe to rethink medical education's role in preparing tomorrow's physicians as leaders.

T1  - Transforming medical professionalism to fit changing health needs.
A1  - Plochg, Thomas
A1  - Klazinga, Niek S
A1  - Starfield, Barbara
Y1  - 2009//
N2  - BACKGROUND: The professional organization of medical work no longer reflects the changing health needs caused by the growing number of complex and chronically ill patients. Key stakeholders enforce coordination and remove power from the medical professions in order allow for these changes. However, it may also be necessary to initiate basic changes to way in which the medical professionals work in order to adapt to the changing health needs., DISCUSSION: Medical leaders, supported by health policy makers, can consciously activate the self-regulatory capacity of medical professionalism in order to transform the medical profession and the related professional processes of care so that it can adapt to the changing health needs. In doing so, they would open up additional routes to the improvement of the health services system and to health improvement. This involves three consecutive steps: (1) defining and categorizing the health needs of the population; (2) reorganizing the specialty domains around the needs of population groups; (3) reorganizing the specialty domains by eliminating work that could be done by less educated personnel or by the patients themselves. We suggest seven strategies that are required in order to achieve this transformation., SUMMARY: Changing medical professionalism to fit the changing health needs will not be easy. It will need strong leadership. But, if the medical world does not embark on this endeavour, good doctoring will become merely a bureaucratic and/or marketing exercise that obscures the ultimate goal of medicine which is to optimize the health of both individuals and the entire population.

T1  - What criteria do faculty use when rating students as potential house officers?.
A1  - Hoffman, Kimberly

Y1  - 2009//
N2  - Third-year medical students' grades are a combination of faculty observations, National Board of Medical Examiners examinations, and other departmental specific course requirements. Faculty evaluations include assessment of students' clinical skills, and a global rating for potential as house officer. We wished to better understand the 'potential as house officer' and to understand if these competencies were shared across the third year or unique to a given discipline. We then examined the relationship between house officer potential and performance on traditional measures of success. We analyzed the narrative comments from faculty evaluations of third-year students who faculty rated as 'Outstanding' in the house officer potential category. The low correlations found between house officer potential and traditional measures of academic success indicate that items beyond the stated learning objectives are influencing faculty evaluation of clinical students. Our data suggest that the awarding of 'potential for house officer' reflects the student's ability to work as part of a health care team. Although there appear to be common elements among the house officer comments, we also observed discipline specific differences. Given the importance placed on house officer potential, more conversation is needed to develop a common language across the third-year courses.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this review is to develop an evidence-focused and work-based model framework for patient safety training, that is, reporting and learning from adverse events in chiropractic care. This article will not debate specific issues of adverse events from spinal manipulation. The main focus is on education for patient safety., METHODS: We conducted a systematic search and synthesized 196 articles on patient safety to provide guidance. The review was carried out by the 2 authors independently in 3 ways: research type, relevancy with respect to patient safety, safety culture or climate, and distinct description of one or more of the adapted Bland's characteristics., RESULTS: Fifty-five articles were included. Their review provided knowledge acquisition and practice behavior regarding patient safety issues and excellent baseline data on reporting and learning of adverse events for training purpose., CONCLUSIONS: Leadership, commitment, and communication together with trust and openness to build a culture of patient safety are prerequisites for successful reporting and learning.

T1  - Developing physician-leaders: a call to action.
A1  - Stoller, James K
Y1  - 2009//
N2  - BACKGROUND: The many challenges in health care today create a special need for great leadership. However, traditional criteria for physicians' advancement to leadership positions often regard academic and/or clinical accomplishments rather than the distinctive competencies needed to lead. Furthermore, physicians' training can handicap their developing leadership skills. In this context, an emerging trend is for health-care institutions to offer physician-leadership programs., METHODS AND RESULTS: This paper reviews the rationale for developing physician-leaders. Factors that underscore this need include: (1) physicians may lack inclinations to collaborate and to follow, (2) health-care organizations pose challenging environments in which to lead (e.g., because of silo-based structures, etc.), (3) traditional criteria for advancement in medicine regard clinical and/or academic skills rather than leadership competencies, and (4) little attention is currently given to training physicians regarding leadership competencies., CONCLUSION: Definition of these competencies of ideal physician-leaders will inform the curricula and format of emerging physician leadership development programs.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: On 1 January 2004, a new medical specialist reform was implemented. The Danish School of Education, University of Aarhus, conducted research from 2002-2006 in the form of two studies to study educational practice within medical specialist training programmes. This article, based on selected data from the second study, sheds light on the reception of the reform's seven competence roles. The roles represented a pedagogical paradigm shift which calls for a new interpretation of the spectrum of medical expertise. However, the reform's reception has not previously been subject to qualitative analysis., MATERIAL AND METHODS: The qualitative data consists of two semi-structured focus group interviews comprising 13 doctors and six rounds of observation of three junior hospital doctors with individual follow-up interviews., RESULTS: The study shows that, almost two years after the reform's introduction, the roles were not ascribed equal value by the doctors, even if this was intended by the reform. The description of competence objectives does not sufficiently reflect everyday practice where competences are often socially situated and constructed. Furthermore, the study indicates a need for training of supervisors in the evaluation of the competence objectives., CONCLUSION: The doctors' perception of the roles indicate a discrepancy between their official formulation and everyday practice. This discrepancy can partly be attributed to the profession's focus on the role as medical expert, inexhaustive descriptions of objectives, and a surfeit of pedagogical qualifications among instructors.

T1  - Teaching the physician-manager role to psychiatric residents: development and implementation of a pilot curriculum.
A1  - Stergiopoulos, Vicky
A1  - Maggi, Julie
A1  - Sockalingam, Sanjeev
Y1  - 2009//
N2  - OBJECTIVE: The authors describe a pilot physician-manager curriculum designed to address the learning needs of psychiatric residents in administrative psychiatry and health systems., METHODS: The pilot curriculum includes a junior and a senior toolkit of four workshops each. The junior toolkit introduces postgraduate-year two (PGY-2) residents to the principles of teamwork, conflict resolution, quality improvement, and program planning and evaluation. The senior toolkit exposes PGY-4 residents to leadership and change management, organizational structures, mental health and addictions reform, and self and career development. Following curriculum implementation at the University of Toronto, residents rated the importance and clinical relevance of curriculum objectives and commented on the strengths and weaknesses of the workshops and areas needing improvement., RESULTS: The pilot curriculum was successfully introduced at the University of Toronto in 2006. Residents rated the curriculum very highly and commented that interactive learning and contextually relevant topics are essential in meeting their needs., CONCLUSION: It is possible to successfully introduce a physician-manager curriculum early during psychiatric residency training, to match the specific needs of clinical rotations. Interactive techniques and clinical illustrations may be crucial in facilitating teaching and learning the physician-manager role. The authors discuss barriers, facilitators, and critical success factors in implementing such a curriculum.

N2  - PURPOSE: The Program in Clinical Effectiveness (PCE) at Harvard School of Public Health is a postgraduate program emphasizing clinical research. The authors sought to evaluate the research careers of physician graduates and to determine correlates of National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant funding., METHOD: In 2006, all 1,489 graduates from 1986-2005 were sent a 48-item survey that collected information on demographics, program experience, chosen career path, grant awards, and research pursued postprogram. Reported NIH grants were verified on the NIH Computer Retrieval of Information on Scientific Projects Web site. Cox proportional hazard regression was used to determine participant and program features associated with NIH grant funding., RESULTS: Overall, 994 of the 1,365 located graduates (73%) responded to the survey. Graduates pursued research in the following areas: 437 respondents (44%) pursued clinical trials, 537 (54%) pursued epidemiology, and 408 (41%) pursued health services research. A total of 156 respondents (24%) were principal investigators on an NIH grant. Correlates of receiving NIH grant funding included age less than 40 years at time of program enrollment (hazard ratio [HR] 1.87, CI 1.03, 3.41), generalist status (HR 1.57, CI 1.14, 2.16), and publishing research begun as course projects (HR 1.65, CI 1.19, 2.31). Gender, academic status at enrollment, ethnicity, tuition sponsorship, and earning an advanced degree were not associated with receipt of NIH grant funding., CONCLUSIONS: Physicians who enrolled in the PCE at an early age and generalist physicians were particularly successful in establishing careers as clinician-investigators. Programs such as the PCE can help to sustain the workforce of physician-investigators.

T1  - Equipping surgeons as educators.
A1  - Fry, Heather
Y1  - 2009//
N2  - There is a developing interest in equipping surgeons as educators but a perceived lack of knowledge and evidence about how to do this effectively, or how to reward and recognize educational expertise within the surgical career structure. A brief consideration of the surgical educator role is offered. The findings and conclusions of a meta-analysis of the influence of faculty development in medical education are summarized. Various sources are drawn on to present an overview of master's level provision in medical education and a master's in surgical education is outlined. Issues relating to developing suitable curricula, educational accreditation, recognition, reward and career structure are raised and some UK approaches to these areas summarized. Evidence indicates the importance of context in training medical educators, the value of experiential learning, training that is spread over time and training that mixes theory, practice and reflection. A schema for recognizing educational expertise, created as an outcome of analysis of the evidence and current provision, is presented. The effect of a possible change from educational training being voluntary to the introduction of a compulsory regime is raised as an area requiring further discussion and evidence collection. Mechanisms by which to acknowledge, reward and recognize education expertise in surgeons do not generally exist; it is suggested their development would be timely.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Current surgical training provides little opportunity for surgeons to recognize and manage intraoperative stress before it affects performance and compromises patient safety. We explored the perceived need for structured stress training and propose an intervention design that may be acceptable and appropriate., METHODS: Fifteen semistructured interviews identified stressors in the operating room, characterized coping strategies, and explored surgeons' views about a training intervention. Interviews were analyzed using standard qualitative methods., RESULTS: Stressors and coping strategies confirmed those identified in previous work. Key components of an intervention should include recognizing stress in oneself and in others; experiencing the impact of stress on performance; providing effective coping strategies; offering feedback; and providing opportunities to practice what has been taught in a safe, simulation-based environment., CONCLUSIONS: There is a need for structured training in management of intraoperative stress. Surgeons would welcome a simulation-based intervention to enhance performance and patient safety.

Y1  - 2009//
N2  - PURPOSE: To investigate ophthalmology residency program leadership expectations regarding resident competency in retinal procedures by graduation and to investigate resident experience performing retinal procedures., METHODS: A survey was emailed to the program director at each accredited US ophthalmology training program., RESULTS: Completed surveys were received from 37/117 (32%) programs. Most respondents identified panretinal photocoagulation (100%), laser for retinal tear (100%), laser for diabetic macular edema (94%), laser for macular edema associated with branch retinal vein occlusion (92%), intravitreal injection (83%), and vitreous tap/intravitreal injection (78%) as procedures residency graduates should be competent to perform; 89%, 3%, 64%, 17%, 14%, and 3% reported residents perform >20 such cases, respectively, as primary surgeon, and 0%, 56%, 6%, 37%, 46%, and 63% reported residents perform one to five such cases, respectively. Competency in scleral buckling and pars plana vitrectomy was expected by 17% and 19%, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: Most respondents expect residency graduates to be competent in retinal laser and injection procedures. Competency in incisional retinal procedures is generally not expected. For some laser and injection procedures, a substantial proportion of residents perform one to five cases as primary surgeon.

T1  - Developing physician-leaders: key competencies and available programs.
A1  - Stoller, James K
Y1  - 2008//
N2  - Because effective leadership is critical to organizational success, frontrunner organizations cultivate leaders for bench depth and pipeline development. The many challenges in healthcare today create a special need for great leadership. This paper reviews the leadership competencies needed by physician-leaders and current experience with developing physician-leaders in healthcare institution-sponsored programs. On the basis of this review, six key leadership competency domains are proposed: 1. technical skills and knowledge (regarding operational, financial, and information systems, human resources, and strategic planning), 2. industry knowledge (e.g., regarding clinical processes, regulation, and healthcare trends), 3. problem-solving skills, 4. emotional intelligence, 5. communication, and 6. a commitment to lifelong learning. Review of current experience indicates that, in addition to leadership training through degree and certificate-granting programs (e.g., by universities and/or official medical societies), healthcare institutions themselves are developing intramural programs to cultivate physician-leaders. Greater attention is needed to assessing the impact and effectiveness of such programs in developing leaders and benefiting organizational outcomes.

N2  - The radiology manager can be influential in promoting group cohesiveness within the department. Identifying qualities that radiology managers believe to be descriptive of cohesive work teams could be very informative for other radiology managers. The surveyed radiology managers had a positive perception of their work groups based on the factors that promote cohesion and achievement. The survey instrument developed has high internal correlation for future use with other radiology managers and employee groups. Continued research is needed to determine if these group results are indicative of the larger field of radiology management

Y1  - 2008//
N2  - BACKGROUND: Medical education, like other forms of professional preparation, is a complex and demanding process, which can benefit enormously from careful research. Although such research can be conducted by researchers from outside medical education, there is also a clear need for clinicians to participate in such research and conduct studies that can draw upon their experience and insights. However, despite recent endeavours to involve clinical educators in such research, there are very few published articles reporting research conducted by such individuals., OBJECTIVE: To explore the factors that impact upon clinicians' engagement in medical education research., METHOD: Interview data, concerning potential involvement in medical education research, were gathered directly from 20 clinicians. A detailed systematic analysis was conducted on the interview transcripts., RESULTS: Three general themes emerged from the interviews, all of which relate to clinicians' engagement in medical education research. They are: (a) effective leadership, (b) promoting professional growth, and (c) all-encompassing support., CONCLUSION: The study shows that there is a need for clinical leaders with inspirational qualities to drive research in medical education. Also, clinicians need better training in educational research methods and more funding is needed to support this type of research.

N2  - Engaging physicians in health care administration is critical. Within Canada, physician leadership programs have not been designed to meet the needs of medical directors in Long-Term Care (LTC). This article explains how a pilot program for medical directors in LTC was created to develop their leadership skills, and how it has now become an annual event. The program must evolve to enable medical directors to participate in system change and innovation within LTC.

T1  - Leadership in graduate medical education: eleven steps instrumental in recovering residency programs after a disaster.
A1  - Wiese, Jeffrey G
Y1  - 2008//
N2  - BACKGROUND: A disaster such as Hurricane Katrina can result in extensive devastation to graduate medical education programs. While clinical services largely determine the recovery of each residency program, program director leadership is important., METHODS: A qualitative survey of program directors was conducted to determine the leadership lessons most instrumental after a disaster., RESULTS: Gaining control, establishing communication, designing a vision for the recovery, maintaining physical accessibility, and identifying leaders within the program were identified as critical leadership attributes associated with a residency program's recovery. Understanding the logistics and finances of resident placement was also important., CONCLUSIONS: Preparing for a disaster is the best approach, but where a disaster policy is incomplete or inadequate, it will be the leadership skills of the program's director that will define the success of failure of the residency program.

N2  - We examined trends in doctoral education in public health and the challenges facing practice-oriented doctor of public health (DrPH) programs. We found a rapid rise in the numbers of doctoral programs and students. Most of the increase was in PhD students who in 2006 composed 73% of the total 5247 current public health doctoral students, compared with 53% in 1985. There has also been a substantial increase (40%) in students in DrPH programs since 2002. Challenges raised by the increased demand for DrPH practice-oriented education relate to admissions, curriculum, assessment processes, and faculty hiring and promotion. We describe approaches to practice-based doctoral education taken by three schools of public health.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: The need for leadership training has become recognized as being highly important to improving medical care, and should be included in surgical resident education curriculums., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Surgical residents (n = 65) completed the 5x-short version of the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire as a means of identifying leadership areas most in need of training among medical residents. The leadership styles of the residents were measured on 12 leadership scales. Comparisons between gender and postgraduate year (PGY) and comparisons to national norms were conducted., RESULTS: Of 12 leadership scales, the residents as a whole had significantly higher management by exception active and passive scores than those of the national norm (t = 6.6, P < 0.01, t = 2.8, P < 0.01, respectively), and significantly lower individualized consideration scores than the norm (t = 2.7, P < 0.01). Only one score, management by exception active was statistically different and higher among males than females (t = 2.12, P < 0.05). PGY3-5 had significantly lower laissez-faire scores than PGY1-2 (t = 2.20, P < 0.05). Principal component analysis revealed two leadership factors with eigenvalues over 1.0. Hierarchical regression found evidence of an augmentation effect for transformational leadership., CONCLUSION: Areas of resident leadership strengths and weaknesses were identified. The Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire was demonstrated to be a valuable tool for identifying specific areas where leadership training would be most beneficial in the educational curriculum. The future use of this instrument could prove valuable to surgical education training programs.

Y1  - 2008//
N2  - To assess confidence in resuscitation skills among pediatric residents and its relationship to training and experience, all pediatric residents at one institution were surveyed regarding their confidence in technical and leadership resuscitation skills and their prior experience with real and mock codes. Respondents (61/82, 74%) reported participation in 4.9 +/- 3.6 mock and 3.9 +/- 5.0 real codes. Confidence score for all skills was 2.7 +/- 0.6 (scale 1-5). Senior residents were more confident than interns (2.8 +/- 0.5 vs 2.3 +/- 0.5). Residents were more confident in basic (3.9 +/- 0.6) than in advanced (2.6 +/- 0.6) or expert resuscitation skills (1.6 +/- 0.7). Confidence correlated with mock codes (r = 0.52) and to a lesser degree with real codes attended (r = 0.36). Performance of active roles and debriefing occurred more commonly with mock than with real codes. The data indicate that pediatric residents have limited confidence in resuscitation skills and that mock code training with active participation and debriefing may be an effective educational tool.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The authors describe in detail the 3-year model of the Doctoring curriculum plus an elective fourth-year Doctoring course at University of California, Davis School of Medicine (UCDSOM) and University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) School of Medicine and the critical role for psychiatry faculty leadership and participation., METHODS: The authors present a review of curricular materials and course operations for the different Doctoring courses for first-, second-, third-, and fourth-year curriculum. The authors describe the role of psychiatry faculty in both leadership and in group facilitation., RESULTS: The Doctoring curriculum offers case-based, small-group learning that relies heavily on standardized patients to teach core content around doctor-patient communication, ethics, behavioral medicine, and counseling approaches. There are frequent psychosocial issues woven in to these encounters. Psychiatry faculty members and other mental health professionals are well-prepared by virtue of their training to lead small group discussions and facilitate the supportive elements of the small groups in medical education., CONCLUSION: The Doctoring curriculum is both a biopsychosocial educational endeavor and a high-visibility leadership opportunity for the Department of Psychiatry. Other medical schools and departments of psychiatry may wish to pursue similar roles in their didactic programs.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Contemporary events in the United States (eg, September 2001, school shootings), Europe (eg, Madrid train bombings), and the Middle East have raised awareness of mass casualty events and the need for a capable disaster response. Recent natural disasters have highlighted the poor preparation and infrastructure in place to respond to mass casualty events. In response, public health policy makers and emergency planners developed plans and prepared emergency response systems. Emergency response providers include first responders, a subset of emergency professionals, including firemen, law enforcement, paramedics, who respond to the incident scene and first receivers, a set of healthcare workers who receive the disaster victims at hospital facilities. The role of pediatric surgeons in mass casualty emergency response plans remains undefined. The authors hypothesize that pediatric surgeons' training and experience will predict their willingness and ability to be activated first receivers. The objective of our study was to determine the baseline experience, preparedness, willingness, and availability of pediatric surgeons to participate as activated first receivers., METHODS: After institutional review board approval, the authors conducted an anonymous online survey of members of the American Pediatric Surgical Association in 2007. The authors explored four domains in this survey: (1) demographics, (2) disaster experience and perceived preparedness, (3) attitudes regarding responsibility and willingness to participate in a disaster response, and (4) availability to participate in a disaster response. The authors performed univariate and bivariate analyses to determine significance. Finally, the authors conducted a logistic regression to determine whether experience or preparedness factors affected the respondent's availability or willingness to respond to a disaster as a first receiver, RESULTS: The authors sent 725 invitations and received 265 (36.6 percent) completed surveys. Overall, the authors found that 77 percent of the respondents felt "definitely" responsible for helping out during a disaster but only 24 percent of respondents felt "definitely"prepared to respond to a disaster. Most felt they needed additional training, with 74 percent stating that they definitely or probably needed to do more training. Among experiential factors, the authors found that attendance at a national conference was associated with the highest sense of preparedness. The authors determined that subjects with actual disaster experience were about four times more likely to feel prepared than those with no disaster experience (p < 0.001). The authors also demonstrated that individuals with a defined leadership position in a disaster response plan are twice as likely to feel prepared (p = 0.002) and nearly five times more willing to respond to a disaster than those without a leadership role. The authors found other factors that predicted willingness including the following: a contractual agreement to respond (OR 2.3); combat experience (OR 2.1); and prior disaster experience (OR 2.0). Finally, the authors found that no experiential variables or training types were associated with an increased availability to respond to a disaster., CONCLUSIONS: A minority of pediatric surgeons feel prepared, and most feel they require more training. Current training methods may be ineffectual in building a prepared and willing pool of first receivers. Disaster planners must plan for healthcare worker related issues, such as transportation and communication. Further work and emphasis is needed to bolster participation in disaster preparedness training.

N2  - Chief residents (CRs) play a crucial role in training residents and students but may have limited geriatrics training or formal preparation for their CR role. A 2-day off-site chief resident immersion training (CRIT) addressed these challenges. Objectives were to foster collaboration between disciplines in the management of complex older patients, increase knowledge of geriatrics principles to incorporate into teaching, enhance leadership skills, and help CRs develop an achievable project for implementation in their CR year. Three cohorts totaling 47 trainees and 18 faculty mentors from 13 medical and surgical disciplines participated over 3 successive years. The curriculum, developed and taught by a multidisciplinary team, featured an interactive surgical case, mini-lectures on geriatrics topics, seminars to enhance teaching and leadership skills, and one-on-one mentoring to develop a project in geriatric care or education. Evaluation included pre- and postprogram tests and self-report surveys and two follow-up surveys or interviews. In 2006 and 2007, scores on a 12-item objective knowledge test increased significantly (P<.001) from before to immediately after CRIT. Self-report knowledge and confidence in teaching geriatrics also increased significantly (P<.05) in all formally covered topics. Mean enhancement of CR skills was 4.3 (1=not at all, 5=very much). Eleven months after CRIT, all but five CRs had implemented at least part of their action projects. CRs reported improved care of older patients, better leadership skills, more and better geriatrics teaching, and more collaboration between disciplines. A 2-day interactive program for CRs can increase institutional capacity regarding geriatrics teaching and care of elderly patients across medical specialties.

Y1  - 2008//
N2  - Reform of the payment and delivery systems in American health care is now being discussed at the highest levels of business and government. Family medicine educators, researchers, and program leaders have an opportunity to provide substantial leadership to this process in their own communities and nationally. To do so, they must reconsider the assumptions made in creating our current systems of practice and education, and this will require new leadership skills that focus on innovation and adaptability. It will also require a more aggressive willingness to test new ideas and a new scientific method to prove or disprove their value. This essay outlines essential elements of such leadership for those responsible for the education of future generations of family physicians.

N2  - In 2003, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center (DHMC) inaugurated its Leadership Preventive Medicine residency (DHLPMR), which combines two years of leadership preventive medicine (LPM) training with another DHMC residency. The aim of DHLPMR is to attract and develop physicians who seek to become capable of leading change and improvement of the systems where people and health care meet. The capabilities learned by residents are (1) leadership -- including design and redesign -- of small systems in health care, (2) measurement of illness burden in individuals and populations, (3) measurement of the outcomes of health service interventions, (4) leadership of change for improvement of quality, value, and safety of health care of individuals and populations, and (5) reflection on personal professional practice enabling personal and professional development. The DHLPMR program includes completion of an MPH degree at The Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice (formerly the Center for Evaluative Clinical Sciences) and a practicum during which the resident leads change to improve health care for a defined population of patients. Residents also complete a longitudinal public health experience in a governmental public health agency. A coach in the resident's home clinical department helps the resident develop his or her practicum proposal, which must then be approved by a practicum review board (PRB). Twelve residents have graduated as of July 2007. Residents have combined anesthesia, family medicine, internal medicine, infectious disease, pain medicine, pathology, psychiatry, pulmonary and critical care medicine, surgery, gastroenterology, geriatric psychiatry, obstetrics-gynecology, and pediatrics with preventive medicine.

N2  - Founded in 1970 to train physicians to practice in community health centers and underserved areas, the Residency Program in Social Medicine (RPSM) of Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York, has graduated 562 board-eligible family physicians, general internists, and pediatricians whose careers fulfill this mission. The RPSM was a model for federal funding for primary care residency programs and has received Title VII grants during most of its history. The RPSM has tailored its mission and structured its curriculum to promote a community and population orientation and to provide the requisite knowledge and skills for integrating social medicine into clinical practice. Six unique hallmarks of RPSM training are (1) mission-oriented resident recruitment/selection and self-management, (2) interdisciplinary collaborative training among primary care professionals, (3) community-health-center-based and community-oriented primary care education, (4) biopsychosocial and ecological family systems curriculum, (5) the social medicine core curriculum and projects, and (6) grant support through Title VII. These hallmark curricular, training, and funding elements, in which population health is deeply embedded, have been carefully evaluated, regularly revised, and empirically validated since the program's inception. Practice outcomes for RPSM graduates as leaders in and advocates for population health and the care of underserved communities are described and discussed in this case study.

N2  - As the importance of physician involvement and leadership in crisis preparedness is recognized, the literature suggests that few physicians are adequately trained to practice effectively in a large-scale crisis situation. A logical method for addressing the emergency preparedness training deficiency identified across several medical specialties is to include disaster and emergency preparedness training in residency curricula. In this article, the authors outline the development and implementation of an emergency preparedness curriculum for the Johns Hopkins General Preventive Medicine Residency (JHGPMR) from 2004 to 2006. The curriculum consists of two components. The first was developed for the academic year in the JHGPMR and includes didactic lectures, practical exercises to apply new knowledge, and an opportunity to integrate the knowledge and skills in a real-world exercise. The second, developed for the practicum year of the residency, includes Web-based lectures and online content and culminates in a tabletop preparedness exercise. Topics for both components include weapons of mass destruction, risk communication and personal preparedness, aspects of local emergency response planning, and mental health and psychological aspects of terrorism. On the basis of the emergency preparedness training gap that has been identified in the literature, and the success of the three-year experience in implementing a preparedness training curriculum in the JHGPMR, the authors recommend incorporation of competency-based emergency preparedness training for residencies of all specialties, and offer insights into how the described curriculum could be adapted for use in other residency settings.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate that a surgery "educational" chief resident can develop a resident-centered, evidence-based, surgical basic/clinical science curriculum that will improve American Board of Surgery In-Training Examination (ABSITE) scores., DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study., METHODS: Two curriculums were developed by 2 surgical "educational" chief residents (in their final year of training), for the academic years 2005-2006 and 2006-2007. The primary roles of these individuals were to design and maintain a surgical curriculum under the ongoing supervision of the program director. In 2005/2006, a baseline weekly lecture series was developed by assigning topics from multiple textbooks to members of the surgical faculty based on their respective surgical specialties. In 2006/2007, a similar approach was used; however, the lecture series was accompanied by additional activities that have been described in the literature as useful in improving ABSITE performance. These activities included recommended reading assignments, ABSITE-styled questions based on the weekly lecture topic, problem-based learning conferences, and an ABSITE remediation course. To assess the 2 approaches, conference attendance and mean ABSITE total test percent correct scores for categorical and preliminary surgical residents in their 1st through 4th postgraduate years (PGY) of training in 2005/2006 and 2nd through 5th years in 2006/2007 were followed. Subgroup analysis of conference attendance and mean ABSITE percent correct scores was performed on those participating versus those not participating in the ABSITE remediation course. A Likert survey was performed to assess our surgical curriculum in 2007., RESULTS: Twenty-five residents participated in both the 2005/2006 and the 2006/2007 surgical curriculums. Twelve residents were assigned to mandatory remediation, whereas 13 were not required to participate in remediation in 2006/2007. Conference attendance did not significantly change between 2005/2006 and 2006/2007 among remediating residents (75% vs 69%, p = 0.23) but did significantly increase among nonremediating residents (76% vs 83%, p = 0.05). Overall, mean ABSITE percent correct scores significantly increased between the 2006 and the 2007 tests (64.8% vs 71.0%, p = 0.002). In subgroup analysis, those who underwent ABSITE remediation significantly increased their ABSITE score by an average of 10.2 percentage points (p = 0.0002), whereas those not participating in the course did not significantly change their score (2.5 percentage points, p = 0.36). A Likert survey assessing this year's curriculum showed that all components of this year's curriculum were "Somewhat useful" to "Very useful" in both improving surgical knowledge base and preparing for the ABSITE., CONCLUSION: An educational chief resident designed surgical curriculum, including weekly reading assignments, weekly ABSITE-styled questions, monthly chief resident problem-based conferences, and an ABSITE remediation course, may augment a basic/clinical science lecture series and may improve ABSITE performance.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Acknowledging the need to improve team communication and coordination among health care providers, health care administrators and improvement officers have been quick to endorse and invest in aviation crew resource management (CRM). Despite the increased interest in CRM there exists limited data on the effectiveness of CRM to change team behavior and performance in clinical settings., METHODS: Direct observational analyses were performed on 30 surgical teams (15 neurosurgery cases and 15 cardiac cases) to evaluate surgical team compliance with integrated safety and CRM practices after extensive CRM training., RESULTS: Observed surgical teams were compliant with only 60% of the CRM and perioperative safety practices emphasized in the training program., CONCLUSIONS: The results highlight many of the challenges the health care industry faces in its efforts to adapt CRM from aviation to medicine. Additional research is needed to develop and test new team training methods and performance feedback mechanisms for clinical teams.

N2  - A four-year faculty development program to enhance geriatrics learning among house officers in seven surgical and related disciplines and five medical subspecialties at a large academic institution resulted in changes in attitudes and knowledge of faculty participants, expanded curricula and teaching activities in geriatrics, and enhanced and altered career trajectories of faculty participants. The program centered on problem-oriented longitudinal small group seminars with concurrent application of new skills. Key success factors included securing the active support of institutional leaders, focus on career development, examining presumptions regarding professional scope, protected time for faculty participants, and provision of teaching and evaluation resources for individualized application by faculty.

N2  - The current state of physician leadership education consists mainly of executive degree programs designed for midcareer physicians. In 2004, the authors proposed that, by educating medical students in physician leadership and integrating this with a business management or public health degree program, graduates, health care organizations, and communities would benefit sooner. Given the lack of program models to guide program integration and development, the authors began a one-year inquiry to build a model leadership curriculum and integrate leadership education across degree programs. The qualitative inquiry resulted in several linked tasks. First, the authors identified a feasible method for concurrently delivering all three program components (MD degree, Leadership Curriculum, and MBA or MPH degree) during a five-year plan. Second, the authors chose a competency-based educational framework for leadership and then identified, adapted, and validated existing leadership competencies to their context. Third, the authors performed an extensive program alignment to identify existing overlaps and opportunities for integration within and across program components. Fourth, the authors performed a needs analysis to identify educational gaps, subsequently leading to redesigning two courses and to designing three new courses. A description of the Leadership Curriculum is also provided. This inquiry has led to the development of the Boonshoft Physician Leadership Development Program, which provides physician leadership education integrated with medical education and education in business management or public heath. Future program initiatives include developing leadership student assessment tools and testing the link between program activities and short- and long-term outcome measures of program success.

N2  - The Physician Manager role has been identified as an essential competency for physicians. There are only a small number of training programs throughout Canada and the USA that offer formal curricula aimed at preparing psychiatry residents for their early career as Physician Managers. Given the expressed need arising from a wide range of stakeholders, our group at the University of Toronto embarked on the process of developing a Physician Manager curriculum for residents in psychiatry. This article describes the process we undertook to facilitate this curricular change, with a focus on select concepts in change management as it applies to curricular change, and the associated barriers and facilitators. Additionally, the article focuses on the role of the psychiatrist in the process.

The program confers a DrPH in health administration. This paper describes the program goals, admissions criteria, program structure and content, use of technology and results of initial program evaluations. Lessons learned during the planning and first three years of operation may assist others as they evaluate the feasibility and desirability of creating similar doctoral-level distance education programs. A critical need exists for additional programs able to attract and prepare top health leaders. This distance DrPH leadership program is one model for what may be the beginning of a promising new era in health leadership education.

N2  - In July 2003, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) established nationwide guidelines for resident working environments and duty hours. Following these guidelines became a requirement for all accredited residency programs. Two years after implementation, we conducted a national survey to assess the opinions and attitudes of orthopedic residents and program directors toward the ACGME work-hour regulations and the effects of these regulations on resident education, resident quality of life, and patient care. Nine hundred seventy-six residents (30% response rate) and 85 program directors (56% response rate) completed the questionnaire. For resident education, junior residents were more likely than senior residents and program directors to perceive the work-hour regulations as having a positive effect on education. There was overall agreement among the 3 groups that resident quality of life had improved as a result of work-hour regulations. For patient care, junior residents viewed the new regulations positively for surgical training and patient care, whereas senior residents and program directors disagreed. This survey showed meaningful differences in the attitudes and opinions of junior residents, senior residents, and program directors toward the new ACGME work-hour regulations.

Y1  - 2007//
N2  - Fourteen nursing home residents on a dementia special care unit at a skilled nursing facility took part in one-to-one intergenerational programming (IGP) with 15 preschool children from the facility's on-site child care center. Montessori-based activities served as the interface for interactions between dyads. The amount of time residents demonstrated positive and negative forms of engagement during IGP and standard activities programming was assessed through direct observation using a tool developed for this purpose--the Myers Research Institute Engagement Scale (MRI-ES). These residents with dementia displayed the ability to successfully take part in IGP. Most successfully presented "lessons" to the children in their dyads, similar to the way that Montessori teachers present lessons to children, while persons with more severe cognitive impairment took part in IGP through other methods such as parallel play. Taking part in IGP was consistently related with higher levels of positive engagement and lower levels of negative forms of engagement in these residents with dementia than levels seen in standard activities programming on the unit. Implications of using this form of IGP, and directions for future research, are discussed.

T1  - Perceptions by practicing occupational therapists of the clinical doctorate in occupational therapy.
A1  - Smith, Diane Lynn
Y1  - 2007//
N2  - Despite recent discussions regarding the implementation of the clinical doctorate in occupational therapy (OTD) as the entry-level degree for occupational therapy, there is a dearth of published literature that addresses the issue of the OTD. In this study, recent alumni of an occupational therapy program from an urban midwestern university were surveyed to determine their perceptions of the OTD. Most respondents agreed or strongly agreed that the OTD curriculum should include courses about managed care and/or insurance regulations, business management/administration, effective professional communication, research, and specialization in a specific area of occupational therapy. Respondents believed that an OTD would assist in career advancement, obtaining a higher salary, and professional competence. However, the majority of respondents did not believe that an OTD would result in enhancement of interprofessional relationships, improved reimbursement from third-party payers, and enhanced public recognition of the profession or enhanced ability to practice without a referral. There was not a strong opinion whether there is an advantage to a clinical doctorate degree, and only 22% agreed or strongly agreed that they would be interested in pursuing a postprofessional OTD.

T1  - Are Australasian academic physicians an endangered species?.
A1  - Wilson, A
Y1  - 2007//
N1  - Comment in: Intern Med J. 2008 Jul;38(7):616-7; PMID: 18715316
N2  - It has been stated that academic medicine is in a worldwide crisis. Is this decline in hospital academic practice a predictable consequence of modern clinical practice with its emphasis on community and outpatient-based services as well as a corporate health-care ethos or does it relate to innate problems in the training process and career structure for academic clinicians? A better understanding of the barriers to involvement in academic practice, including the effect of gender, the role and effect of overseas training, expectation of further research degrees and issues pertaining to the Australian academic workplace will facilitate recruitment and retention of the next generation of academic clinicians. Physician-scientists remain highly relevant as medical practice and education evolves in the 21st century. Hospital-based academics carry out a critical role in the ongoing mentoring of trainees and junior colleagues, whose training is still largely hospital based in most specialty programmes. Academic clinicians are uniquely placed to translate the rapid advances in medical biology into the clinical sphere, by guiding and carrying out translational research as well as leading clinical studies. Academic physicians also play key leadership in relations with government and industry, in professional groups and medical colleges. Thus, there is a strong case to assess the problems facing recruitment and retention of physician-scientists in academic practice and to develop workable solutions.

N2  - The University of St. Thomas' Physician Leadership College is an 18-month program that trains physicians in leadership and management. It was started in 1999 in response to calls from within the health care industry for more training of physician leaders to guide reform efforts. This article makes the case that physicians need to not only participate in but also to lead change in health care. It also describes the program and reports findings from participants' evaluations.

Y1  - 2007//
N2  - BACKGROUND: Improving physician health and performance is critical to successfully meet the challenges facing health systems that increasingly emphasize productivity. Assessing long-term efficacy and sustainability of programs aimed at enhancing physician and organizational well-being is imperative., OBJECTIVE: To determine whether data-guided interventions and a systematic improvement process to enhance physician work-life balance and organizational efficacy can improve physician and organizational well-being., DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: From 2000 to 2005, 22-32 physicians regularly completed 3 questionnaires coded for privacy. Results were anonymously reported to physicians and the organization. Data-guided interventions to enhance physician and organizational well-being were built on physician control over the work environment, order in the clinical setting, and clinical meaning., MEASUREMENTS: Questionnaires included an ACP/ASIM survey on physician satisfaction, the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), and the Quality Work Competence (QWC) survey., RESULTS: Emotional and work-related exhaustion decreased significantly over the study period (MBI, p = 0.002; QWC, p = 0.035). QWC measures of organizational health significantly improved initially and remained acceptable and stable during the rest of the study., CONCLUSIONS: A data-guided program on physician well-being, using validated instruments and process improvement methods, enhanced physician and organizational well-being. Given the increases in physician burnout, organizations are encouraged to urgently create individual and systems approaches to lessen burnout risk.

Y1  - 2007//
N2  - BACKGROUND: The organisation of specialist training is complex and involves many clinical departments. The position of consultants responsible for education (CRE) in specialist training at department level is poorly defined in the literature., AIMS: The aim of the study was to explore expectations of stakeholders concerning the role and position of a CRE in specialist training., METHOD: The role and position of the CRE was explored using focus group and semi-structured individual interviews., RESULTS: Knowledge of tasks and responsibilities was limited in all stakeholders except among CREs. The expectations of stakeholders to the CRE varied according to their position in the hospital hierarchy. In general terms the CRE was expected to assume overall responsibility for specialist training, promote a positive educational climate and secure quality of specialist training along with numerous administrative tasks. All interviewees expressed a wish for a strong leader at the same time they did not consider the position of the CRE influential., CONCLUSION: Along with improved information about the role of the CRE, formal education, proper job-descriptions and clear leadership in the organisation concerning specialist training might increase the influence and power of CREs.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To explore the nature of corporate gifts directed at PharmD programs and pharmacy student activities and the perceptions of administrators about the potential influences of such gifts., METHODS: A verbally administered survey of administrative officials at 11 US colleges and schools of pharmacy was conducted and responses were analyzed., RESULTS: All respondents indicated accepting corporate gifts or sponsorships for student-related activities in the form of money, grants, scholarships, meals, trinkets, and support for special events, and cited many advantages to corporate partner relationships. Approximately half of the respondents believed that real or potential problems could occur from accepting corporate gifts. Forty-four percent of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that corporate contributions could influence college or school administration. Sixty-one percent agreed or strongly agreed that donations were likely to influence students., CONCLUSIONS: Corporate gifts do influence college and school of administration and students. Policies should be in place to manage this influence appropriately.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Despite its importance in psychiatry residency training, there is little written about the role of chief resident. Invoking principles of credibility, continuity, and inclusion, and the establishment of two roles, as legislative and representative leader, this article offers a model for how a residency program can empower its chief resident to act decisively, make meaningful contributions to training, and ultimately enhance his or her effectiveness., METHOD: The authors review the literature on the psychiatry chief resident and identify ambiguity as a common and powerful impediment to effective leadership., RESULTS: The authors present a model for psychiatry residency programs to enhance chief resident effectiveness based on the three components of credibility, continuity, and inclusion, and elucidate how each improves chief resident leadership. The authors identify two integral leadership roles of the chief resident, those of the legislative and representative leader, and discuss how each empowers the chief resident to act decisively., CONCLUSIONS: The authors assert that if psychiatry residency programs elect the chief resident by involving both faculty and residents, grant a year-long term and include him or her in all major decisions that involve the residency, the chief resident is far more likely to make meaningful contributions to the training program.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The authors examine qualitative data from outgoing chief residents in psychiatry from the 2004-2005 academic year to 1) determine common characteristics between programs, 2) examine the residents' perspectives on their experiences, and 3) determine their common leadership qualities., METHOD: The authors sent out self-report surveys via e-mail to 89 outgoing chief residents who attended the APA/Lilly Chief Resident Executive Leadership Program., RESULTS: Fifty-three (60%) chief residents responded. Although most chief residents are senior residents, over 20% are in their third postgraduate year. Two-thirds of programs have more than one chief resident each year. Most chief residents believe that their "participating" leadership style, existing leadership skills, and interpersonal skills contributed to their overall positive experiences., CONCLUSIONS: Successfully performing duties as a chief resident entails functioning in a variety of roles and demands attention to leadership qualities of the individual. Developing existing leadership skills, clarifying expectations, and providing mentorship to chief residents will ensure successful transition into practice, and the advancement of the field of psychiatry.

N2  - BACKGROUND: High-reliability organizations have stressed the importance of non-technical skills for safety and of regularly providing such training to their teams. Recently safety skills training has been applied in the practice of medicine. In this study, we developed and piloted a module using multidisciplinary crisis scenarios in a simulated operating theatre to train entire surgical teams., METHODS: Twenty teams participated (n = 80); each consisted of a trainee surgeon, anesthetist, operating department practitioner (ODP), and scrub nurse. Crisis scenarios such as difficult intubation, hemorrhage, or cardiac arrest were simulated. Technical and non-technical skills (leadership, communication, team skills, decision making, and vigilance), were assessed by clinical experts and by two psychologists using relevant technical and human factors rating scales. Participants received technical and non-technical feedback, and the whole team received feedback on teamwork., RESULTS: Trainees assessed the training favorably. For technical skills there were no differences between surgical trainees' assessment scores and the assessment scores of the trainers. However, nurses overrated their technical skill. Regarding non-technical skills, leadership and decision making were scored lower than the other three non-technical skills (communication, team skills, and vigilance). Surgeons scored lower than nurses on communication and teamwork skills. Surgeons and anesthetists scored lower than nurses on leadership., CONCLUSIONS: Multidisciplinary simulation-based team training is feasible and well received by surgical teams. Non-technical skills can be assessed alongside technical skills, and differences in performance indicate where there is a need for further training. Future work should focus on developing team performance measures for training and on the development and evaluation of systematic training for technical and non-technical skills to enhance team performance and safety in surgery.

T1  - Resident-Assisted Montessori Programming (RAMP): use of a small group reading activity run by persons with dementia in adult day health care and long-term care settings.

Y1  - 2007//
N2  - Six persons in the early to middle stages of dementia ("leaders") were trained in Resident-Assisted Montessori Programming (RAMP) to lead a reading activity for 22 persons with more advanced dementia ("participants") in an adult day health center (ADHC) and a special care unit (SCU) in a skilled nursing facility. Researchers assessed the leaders' abilities to learn and follow the procedures of leading a group, as well as their satisfaction with their roles. In addition, participants' engagement and affect were measured, both during standard activities programming and during client-led activities. Results of this study suggest that persons with dementia can indeed successfully lead small group activities, if several important prerequisites are met. Furthermore, the engagement and affect of participants was more positive in client-led activities than in standard activities programming.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine internal medicine residents' perceptions of the adequacy of their training to serve as in-hospital cardiac arrest team leaders, given the responsibility of managing acutely critically ill patients and with recent evidence suggesting that the quality of cardiopulmonary resuscitation provided in teaching hospitals is suboptimal., DESIGN: Cross-sectional postal survey., SETTING: Canadian internal medicine training programs., PARTICIPANTS: Internal medicine residents attending Canadian English-speaking medical schools., INTERVENTIONS: A survey was mailed to internal medicine residents asking questions relating to four domains: adequacy of training, perception of preparedness, adequacy of supervision and feedback, and effectiveness of additional training tools., MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of the 654 residents who were sent the survey, 289 residents (44.2%) responded. Almost half of the respondents (49.3%) felt inadequately trained to lead cardiac arrest teams. Many (50.9%) felt that the advanced cardiac life support course did not provide the necessary training for team leadership. A substantial number of respondents (40%) reported receiving no additional cardiac arrest training beyond the advanced cardiac life support course. Only 52.1% of respondents felt prepared to lead a cardiac arrest team, with 55.3% worrying that they made errors. Few respondents reported receiving supervision during weekdays (14.2%) or evenings and weekends (1.4%). Very few respondents reported receiving postevent debriefing (5.9%) or any performance feedback (1.3%). Level of training and receiving performance feedback were associated with perception of adequacy of training (r(2) = .085, p < .001). Respondents felt that additional training involving full-scale simulation, leadership skills training, and postevent debriefing would be most effective in increasing their skills and confidence., CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that residents perceive deficits in their training and supervision to care for critically ill patients as cardiac arrest team leaders. This raises sufficient concern to prompt teaching hospitals and medical schools to consider including more appropriate supervision, feedback, and further education for residents in their role as cardiac arrest team leaders.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Analyses of adverse events in surgery reveal that underlying causes are often behavioural, such as communication failures, rather than technical. Non-technical (i.e. cognitive and interpersonal) skills, whilst recognised, are not explicitly addressed in surgical training. However, surgeons need to demonstrate high levels of these skills, as well as technical proficiency, to maximise safety and quality in the operating theatre. This article describes a prototype training course to raise surgeons' awareness of non-technical skills., METHODS: The course syllabus was based on a new taxonomy of surgeons' non-technical skills (NOTSS) which has four principal categories: situation awareness, decision-making, communication and teamwork, and leadership. Three, one-day training courses were attended by 21 surgeons., RESULTS: All surgeons reported that they found explicit review and discussion of these skills and component behaviours helpful for self-reflection. They rated the content as interesting and relevant and the majority declared their intention to make some changes to their behaviour during surgery., CONCLUSIONS: It was concluded that this type of training could enhance the surgical training portfolio and should be an integral feature of the development and assessment of operative skills.

N2  - CONTEXT: Management of laboratories and pathology practices is increasingly complex. Residents and fellows in laboratory medicine and pathology need more structured curricula in leadership and management (L&M) training to function as medical and laboratory directors., OBJECTIVE: To define a curriculum that provides basic competency in L&M for residents and fellows in pathology., DESIGN: A year-long formal L&M course included didactic lectures, interactive sessions, case scenarios, team-building exercises, formal team presentations (capstone project), and precourse and postcourse assessment of L&M knowledge. The curriculum meets requirements of American College of Graduate Medical Education and supports goals for leadership training of the College of American Pathologists. Participants evaluated (5-point scale) the content and speakers of all sessions. Trainees were evaluated after considering postcourse examination results, quality of the capstone presentation, and a global assessment., RESULTS: The 5 non-capstone sessions received evaluation scores ranging from 4.4 (informatics) to 5 (L&M basics). Postcourse test scores showed significant improvement when compared with the pretest scores for the 2003-2004 and 2004-2005 trainee cohorts., CONCLUSIONS: Short-term results indicate that the course described improves trainee knowledge of L&M issues.

N2  - As the challenges of leading in healthcare become more complex, healthcare institutions have increasingly emphasized the importance of leadership training for physicians. Several institutions have offered in-house training programs. This paper describes the 14-year experience and evolution of physician leadership development training at the Cleveland Clinic. We describe the curriculum, organization, and goals of the Leading in Health Care course, which is offered to high-potential physician leaders. As a metric of the success of this physician leadership effort, we report the number and types of business plans developed in the course that have been either implemented at the Cleveland Clinic or have directly affected plans for program implementation.

N2  - When prevocational medical trainees become registrars, they have increasing responsibilities for ensuring safe, effective, and timely delivery of health care, while simultaneously performing a number of managerial and leadership roles. Registrars do not currently receive training for their roles as front-line managers, despite this being an identified need by trainees and the health care workers with whom they interact. The national program for the Professional Development of Registrars is a soundly based, well developed and successful generic program that could be applied in a wide variety of postgraduate arenas.

N2  - There are high rates of turnover among graduate nurses within the first year of employment. As the costs of recruitment and orientation have increased, employers are examining new strategies for increasing retention among this population. The Methodist Hospital, Houston, TX, partnered with an academic institution and University Health Consortium to apply an implementation strategy where graduate nurses participate in a year-long residency program. The residents attended monthly sessions that addressed pertinent needs of the group. During this 1-year period turnover decreased from 50% to 13% and return on investment was 326.5%.

T1  - Preparing future teachers and doctoral-level leaders in deaf education: meeting the challenge.
A1  - Andrews, Jean F
A1  - Covell, John A
Y1  - 2006, 2007//
N2  - The deaf education profession faces a critical juncture. First, the 2006 leadership crisis that swept deaf education's flagship institution--Gallaudet University--will propel professionals to think deeply about promoting diversity, equity, and access in deaf education teacher and leadership preparation programs. Second, personnel shortages require attention: Teacher and leadership voids in university and K-12 programs loom if training efforts are not increased. Teaching and leadership needs center on three challenges: (a) understanding the changing demographic composition of the student, teacher, and leadership populations; (b) developing an evolving curriculum founded on research-based practices; (c) continuing to enlarge the knowledge base through applied research in the social sciences. Two case studies examine teacher training and leadership programs at universities that address these challenges. The importance of workplace deaf-hearing bicultural teams is examined. Implications for the preparation of teacher and leadership personnel in deaf education are discussed.

N2  - Despite marked differences in training and professional interests, physicians and hospital administrators face similar problems: failure of reimbursement to keep pace with rising costs, new therapeutic modalities, critical workforce shortages, increasing government and managed care regulation, heightened consumerism, & an aging patient population. In the face of these mounting challenges, both physicians and hospital administrators could benefit significantly from a climate of collaboration and interdependence to optimize interprofessional practice. Teaching people to work with other healthcare professionals who play key roles in healthcare delivery is an important educational mission for the Association of University Programs in Health Administration (AUPHA) and for society in general.

Y1  - 2006//
N2  - Orienting new graduates to the complexities of contemporary healthcare is a challenge for organizational leaders and graduate nurses. While new graduates face one of the most difficult psychological and intellectual periods of adaptation in their careers, organizational leaders struggle not only with the clinical competency of the new nurse but also with the management of multiple transitions that effect their professional performance and patient care. The authors describe the design and implementation of a collaborative academic-service residency program for graduate nurses. The hybrid program includes a master's level course in nursing leadership, facility specific components, and socialization events. Lessons learned are presented so that other nurse leaders may continue to raise the bar in developing future residency programs.

T1  - Physician workforce shortages: implications and issues for academic health centers and policymakers.
A1  - Salsberg, Edward
A1  - Grover, Atul
Y1  - 2006//
N2  - A physician shortage is likely given current levels of medical education and training. Because an increase in physician supply through expansion of U.S. medical school capacity will require ten or more years, there is little time left to affect the supply of new physicians in 2020 when a substantial number of baby boomers will be over 70 years of age. Even with a substantial increase in medical education and training capacity, it is unlikely that all of the increased demand for health services can be met with physicians. In addition to the challenges of expanding medical school enrollment, the nation will need to grapple with other ramifications of demand exceeding supply. This includes assessing how to deliver services more effectively and efficiently and the future roles of the physician and other health professionals. These challenges are particularly difficult for medical schools and teaching hospitals, the cornerstones of medical education and training in the United States. Osteopathic and off-shore schools targeted to Americans have been willing and able to grow more quickly and less expensively than U.S. medical schools, in part because of their more narrow approaches to medical education. In addition, physicians from less developed countries continue to migrate to the United States in significant numbers. Medical schools, teaching hospitals, and policymakers will need to address several major questions as they respond to the shortages. They will either confront and address these issues in the next few years or they will be forced to change by others in the future.

Y1  - 2006//
N2  - Within academic medical centers, psychiatry, pediatrics, and certain other specialties of internal medicine carry a disproportionate responsibility for teaching but are least able to support teaching and research through clinical income. This article reviews the educational, research and clinical missions of an academic psychiatry department and the major challenges facing chairs as they seek to lead their departments. Though the leadership role that the chair plays in psychiatric education, research, and clinical services can be tremendously satisfying, it is also true that being a chair in these times has much in common with "middle management" in other corporate structures.Copyright (C) 2006 Academic Psychiatry.

N2  - The University of Washington Doctor of Nursing Practice program entails 3 curricular dimensions: advanced practice, leadership, and practice inquiry. In this article, the practice inquiry dimension is discussed and defined as a type of clinical investigation that closely aligns with the realities and complexities of everyday practice by advanced practice nurses (APNs). The advancement of APNs' practice inquiry competencies is timely for its interfaces with the national scientific agenda's emphasis on translating science to clinical practice, health care delivery systems and policy. A framework for conceptualizing a practice inquiry curriculum and competencies is proposed. In addition, the divergent and convergent comparisons with Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) nursing programs are discussed, with emphasis placed on potential collaborative clinical research endeavors.

Y1  - 2006//
N2  - Ongoing challenges caused by increased complexity of care, changing patient demographics, and shifting health care delivery systems are necessitating a transformation of advanced practice. The practice doctorate has the potential to prepare graduates to meet these challenges now and in the future. This article conceptualizes the practice doctorate curriculum for nurse practitioners (NPs), with particular focus on how it will prepare NPs as expert clinicians with enhanced leadership and research skills. Nurse practitioner doctoral education and practice is articulated and differentiated from current NP education and practice, with distinguishing features clearly identified. A compelling argument is made for how this educational preparation will facilitate NPs in meeting future societal needs. The purpose of this article is to provide guidance for all advanced practice educational programs considering adoption of a practice doctorate, and to contribute to the advancement of thinking about the practice doctorate for clinicians as well as educators.

N2  - Resident teaching is a competency that must be recognized, developed, and assessed. The ACGME core competencies include the role of physician as educator to "educate patients and families" and to "facilitate the learning of students and other health care professionals." Residents spend a significant proportion of their time in teaching activities, and students report achieving much of their clinical learning from their interactions with residents. Although many residents enjoy their critical role as teacher, many do not feel well prepared to teach. This article summarizes a preliminary curriculum of modules for a resident teacher-training program for emergency medicine residents. The goal of these modules is to provide learning objectives and an initial structure through which residents could improve basic teaching skills. Many of these skills are adaptable to residents' interactions with each other and with students, other healthcare professionals, and patients. Each module and corresponding teaching exercises can be found at http://www.saem.org.

T1  - The professional doctorate for nurses in Australia: findings of a scoping exercise.
A1  - Ellis, Lorraine B
Y1  - 2006//
N2  - This paper presents the findings of a scoping exercise to map the professional doctorate for nurses and midwives in three Australian Universities using a modified form of Illuminative Evaluation. The visit was prompted by the increase in the number and range of professional doctorates introduced in the UK over the last decade which stimulated a desire to obtain details of similar programmes in Australia. Sources of data included course documentation and course work, session content, and interviews with doctoral students enrolled on a professional doctorate. Examination of the Australian professional doctorate indicates that such programmes were developed primarily in response to the perceived limitations of the PhD and a desire to generate practice-relevant research. Programmes were designed specifically for leaders in the 'clinical' field, such as nurse consultants and those aspiring to Clinical Chairs in Nursing. One of the principal aims of the Australian doctorate was to help clinicians acquire skills in multiple methodologies to promote a patient focused research agenda. This approach has clear lessons for the UK and these are presented in the form of recommendations at the close of the paper. This paper will be of interest to those responsible for the provision of the professional doctorate for nurses, sponsors of students, researchers of education and policy makers.

Y1  - 2006//
N2  - OBJECTIVE: To examine associations between management training of physician executives and their leadership styles, as well as effectiveness in achieving disease management goals., STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional national survey., METHODS: Executive directors of community health centers (269 respondents; response rate = 40.9%) were surveyed regarding their perceptions of the medical director's leadership, and for quantitative information on the center's achievement of clinical (mostly disease management) goals. The dependent variables were the medical director's scores (as perceived by the executive director) on transformational, transactional, and laissez-faire leadership, effectiveness, satisfaction with the leader, and subordinate extra effort, using an adapted Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (43 items; 5-point Likert scale). The independent variable was the medical director's management training status., RESULTS: Compared with medical directors with < 30 days of inservice training, medical directors with an MHA, MPH, or MBA, or > or =30 days of in-service training, had 0.32, 0.35, 0.30, 0.36, and 0.37 higher scores on transformational leadership, transactional leadership, rated effectiveness, satisfaction, and subordinate extra effort, respectively, and 0.31 lower score on laissez-faire leadership (all P < .001). Medical directors without management degrees but with > or =30 days of in-service training had 0.34, 0.36, 0.50, and 0.47 higher scores on transformational leadership, transactional leadership, rated effectiveness, and satisfaction with the leader (all P < .02). Our data previously had demonstrated that medical directors' transformational leadership significantly influences achievement of disease management goals., CONCLUSION: Training may enable physician executives to develop leadership styles that are effective in influencing clinical providers' adoption of disease management guidelines under managed care.

Y1  - 2005//
N2  - In the late 1980s, New York State faced projected shortages in the supply of clinicians to meet the burgeoning HIV epidemic. In 1990, the New York State Department of Health AIDS Institute (AI), in collaboration with selected academic, medical center-based Designated AIDS Centers, responded by developing a two-year fellowship training program that provides skills training in the management of HIV disease and the public health aspects of the HIV epidemic. Its primary goal is to increase the number of highly qualified, broadly trained physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and dentists who can assume leadership roles in HIV-related direct care and program administration in New York State. In May 2002, each of the 74 scholars who had completed the full two-year program was mailed a survey that assessed the degree to which program goals had been met. Of the 48 survey respondents, 96 percent (46) had worked in HIV care at some time after completing the program and 90 percent were employed in HIV clinical settings. Of the 25 respondents with no HIV care experience prior to entering the program, 22 (88 percent) pursued careers in the field of HIV care after completing the program and remained in those jobs at the time of the survey. Of the 48 respondents, 42 (88 percent) held leadership positions (as program directors or medical directors), filled leadership roles as members of advisory boards, had published articles in professional journals, or had made presentations at national and international HIV/AIDS conferences; 91 percent of the respondents rated the overall quality of their training experience as "good" or "very good," the highest possible rating. The survey results indicate that this clinical training and leadership development program successfully met its primary goal of building the HIV/AIDS clinical healthcare workforce in New York State. Its success demonstrates that a state-funded, targeted clinical education program can address acute shortages in the public healthcare professional workforce in the absence of other privately or publicly funded professional development initiatives.

Y1  - 2005//
N2  - OBJECTIVE: To show how clinicians can become the leaders of 'quality' in a mental health services, using the example of developments within Northern Sydney Health (NSH) Area Mental Health Services (AMHS)., METHOD: In the absence of an existing integrated area quality programme, NSH AMHS implemented a quality improvement programme whereby staff at the coalface would become the leaders in 'quality' guided and supported by the newly established Quality Unit. This innovative approach is consistent with evidence that suggests that clinicians need to 'own' quality improvement initiatives and embed them into everyday practice, rather than see them as the role of a designated 'quality' person/s., RESULTS: Within 12 months the service trained over 100 clinicians in Clinical Practice Improvement (CPI) methodology and currently has over 20 CPI projects with an identified measurable outcome. As well, it has provided over 200 staff with in-services on quality improvement approaches and trained 45 staff in root cause analysis. Training of eight clinicians in the use of the Minitab statistical package has allowed data analysis and charting to identify opportunities for improvement., CONCLUSION: The handing of 'quality' back to clinicians of the AMHS has provided a framework for improved outcomes for patients and carers. This approach to service improvement is transferable to other mental health services.

Y1  - 2005//
N2  - This article explores the growing trend of physician executive pay-for-performance plans in the U.S. and Canada and discusses the underlying principles of incentive-based compensation models. Pay-for-performance plans are becoming increasingly popular with boards of many healthcare organizations across the country. They may offer an opportunity for increased accountability in the context of the 2003 Health Accord. Although there is little current evidence to support the notion that incentive-based compensation has long-term implications for quality improvement, their popularity continues to increase.

N1  - Comment in: Acad Med. 2005 Dec;80(12):1077-8; PMID: 16306275
N2  - It has been widely accepted and recommended that the needed improvements in the quality of health care require fundamental reforms in medical education. However, it is essential to recognize that there are significant problems not only with the quality but also with the quantity of health care in the United States. The medical profession has to confront the fundamental moral problem of unrealized rights and unattained justice in health care that has resulted in explicit harm to the health of a large portion of the population. Does this state of affairs have anything to do with the ways physicians have been educated about civic responsibilities, leadership, and professional integrity? What kind of education is to be provided for what kind of physicians and for what kind of medicine? Emphasis should be placed on the leadership role and on the underlying attitudes and values of physicians that reflect the morality of medicine. The doctor-patient and doctor-society relationships are part and parcel of the moral and professional responsibilities of physicians. Different moralities are involved when medicine is practiced as a job or business or vocation, because these entail different dispositions toward patients and society. The envisioned educational changes should challenge and prepare physicians not only with regard to their knowledge and skills but also with regard to their moral and professional integrity and leadership, so they may serve individuals and society in a health care system that ensures equal access to high-quality services for all.

Y1  - 2005//
N2  - In this article, we describe the developmental process of a Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) program that uses interdisciplinary resources to create unique DNP curriculum opportunities. Other schools may benefit from this experience in the development of their own DNP programs. The program delivers an innovative curriculum from post-baccalaureate to doctorate, emphasizing health care engineering and interdisciplinary collaboration among faculty, hospitals, community leaders, and policymakers. This DNP program is uniquely situated to provide leadership in solving complex clinical problems through its partnership with the Regenstrief Center for Healthcare Engineering, the School of Pharmacy, the Homeland Security Institute, and the Center on Aging and the Life Course. Doctoral coursework, interdisciplinary collaboration, health care engineering/systems approaches, and new knowledge result in uniquely qualified providers. Post-baccalaureate students complete the university's Adult Nurse Practitioner program or its developing Pediatric Nurse Practitioner program during the first 2 years of the 4-year curriculum. A total of 83 post-baccalaureate credit hours include 1,526 hours of supervised clinical practice, a health policy residency, and cognate residencies in an area of specialization. The seven core competencies recommended by the American Association of Colleges of Nursing are incorporated into the curriculum.

N2  - Education is a driving force in improving the health and welfare of communities globally. Doctoral education of nurses has been identified as a critical factor for provision of leadership in practice, scholarship, research, policy and education. Since the genesis of doctoral education in nursing in the USA in the 1930s, this movement has burgeoned to over 273 doctoral programs in over 30 countries globally. The present article seeks to identify the issues and challenges in nursing doctoral education globally, and those encountered by doctoral program graduates in meeting the challenges of contemporary health care systems. Information was derived from a comprehensive literature review. Electronic databases and the Internet, using the Google search engine, were searched using the key words "doctoral education"; "nursing"; "International Network for Doctoral Education in Nursing"; "global health"; "international research collaboration". Doctoral education has been a critical force in developing nurse leaders in education, management, policy and research domains. An absence of consensus in terminology and of accurate minimum data sets precludes comparison and debate across programs. The complexity and dynamism of contemporary globalized communities render significant challenges in the conduct of doctoral programs. Addressing funding issues and faculty shortages are key issues for doctoral programs, especially those in developing countries, to achieve an identity uniquely their own. These challenges can also afford considerable opportunities for discussion, debate and the formulation of innovative and collaborative solutions to advance nursing knowledge and scholarship. In spite of discrete differences between countries and regions, the similarities in the issues facing the development of doctoral programs internationally are more striking than the differences. The harnessing of a global collective to address these issues will likely serve to not only forge the future viability of doctoral education of nurses but to improve the health and well-being of communities. This paper proposes international collaborative strategies to address a number of the challenges identified.

T1  - A qualitative study of interphysician telephone consultations: extending the opinion leader theory.

A1  - Lingard, Lorelei
Y1  - 2005//
N2  - INTRODUCTION: It has been suggested that the use of opinion leaders in the dissemination of information may be an effective method of changing clinical practice. Recent reviews on this topic, however, have found mixed results and have concluded that further research is needed to explore the circumstances that effectively utilize opinion leaders. We studied the interphysician telephone consultation, a situation in medical practice in which we see opinion leaders at work, to generate a grounded theory of opinion leader activity., METHODS: Data were collected and triangulated among 3 sources: documentation of 129 telephone consultations received, 51 hours of field observations of consultants, and in-depth interviews of 12 callers and 12 consultants. Analysis was performed using grounded theory methods., RESULTS: A rich description of the context and mechanisms of opinion leader activity emerged. The results describe that opinion leader activity is effective in an informal context in which the practicing physician initiates the exchange. Valuable elements of opinion leader activity that emerged included the provision of a personal touch, reassurance, and advice that blends clinical experience with published evidence., DISCUSSION: Our results suggest that key to effective opinion leader activity is an informal practitioner-initiated context. Formal didactic sessions led by opinion leaders, therefore, may not be an effective format. In addition to evidence-based medicine, practicing physicians value "experience-based medicine" and the personal touch and reassurance that contact with an opinion leader can provide. Using opinion leaders as a means of balancing these 2 paradigms may be a useful model for continuing medical education in this domain.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Recent clinical trials indicate that treatment with lipid modifying therapy improves outcomes in patients with ischemic heart disease (IHD) and low levels of high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. The results of these trials, however, have not been widely implemented in clinical practice., OBJECTIVES: To develop and test an intervention designed to increase the rate of prescription of lipid modifying therapy and to determine the relative effectiveness of three different prompts (progress notes, patient letters, or computer chart reminders)., METHODS: The study was conducted in 11 US Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Centers. The effect of the intervention on the proportion of eligible patients receiving lipid modifying therapy was compared between five intervention sites and six matched control sites using a controlled before and after study design. Additionally, 92 providers within the intervention clinics were randomized to receive one of the three prompts. Data were analyzed using logistic regression modeling which incorporated terms to account for the clustered nature of the data., RESULTS: At the intervention sites the prescription rate increased from 8.3% during the pre-intervention period to 39.1% during the intervention (OR = 6.5, 95% CI 5.2 to 8.2, p<0.0001) but remained unchanged at the control sites. The interaction between group (control v intervention) and time period was highly significant (p<0.0001). The adjusted odds of receiving a prescription during the intervention period was 3.1 times higher at the intervention sites than at the control sites (95% CI 2.1 to 4.7). Overall, there was no significant difference in prescription rates among the three prompt groups. However, there was a significant interaction between prompt group and site, indicating that the efficacy of the prompts differed by site., CONCLUSION: An intervention for primary care providers consisting of an educational workshop, opinion leader influence, and prompts substantially increased the prescription rate of lipid modifying therapy.

Y1  - 2005//
N2  - Traditionally, mothers provide banana to their neonates as well as discharge their colostrum prior to breastfeeding, increasing the risk of perinatal morbidity and mortality. Health education modules, based on ethnographic study, to discourage these detrimental practices were developed for use by community leaders. Two thousand six hundred and seventy neonates were followed from birth to 28 days. Overall, neonatal banana feeding decreased 18.3% and colostrum feeding increased 32.8%. Religious leaders, who had strong community influence, had the highest health module execution. Moreover, their influence on the community was important. Overall, the use of ethnographic study data to identify specific cues to action of individuals in a community, such as community religious leaders, is an effective and appropriate method for reducing the detrimental customs of both early solid-food feeding of banana and colostrum discharge prior to breast-feeding, positively affecting community perinatal morbidity and mortality.

Y1  - 2004//
N2  - Nursing leadership has become a major theme of discussions in many countries. The phenomenon is also present in nursing as the profession is redesigning and reinventing itself in all domains of practice. This paper discusses the development of global nursing leaders through doctoral education in the context of 21st century realities. Next, two meanings of global leadership of nursing are reviewed. Finally, doctoral education is focused by looking at worldviews and the challenges ahead in preparing global nursing leaders for the 21st century.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Educationally influential physicians (EIPs) are identified by their colleagues as people who (1) encourage learning and enjoy sharing their knowledge, (2) are clinical experts and always seem up to date, and (3) treat others as equals. We aimed to identify surgical and pathologist EIPs for colorectal cancer (CRC) in Ontario as part of a blended knowledge transfer program., METHODS: A population-based cohort of surgeons (n = 794) and pathologists (n = 449) were sent surveys modeled on the Hiss method for identifying EIPs. Four formal mailings (including incentives) and telephone calls and faxes were completed. This labor-intensive process identified "general" EIPs and surgery or pathology EIPs for CRC. The characteristics of EIPs in these groups were studied., RESULTS: The response rate was 41% for surgeons and 42% for pathologists. One hundred eighteen general EIPs were identified and substantially more surgical EIPs for CRC (n = 63) than pathology EIPs for CRC (n = 6) were recognized. Forty-two of 81 medical centers in Ontario identified an EIP We also identified a cohort of "domain experts, " physicians whose opinion was valued for CRC but who did not meet the Hiss EIP criteria. This cohort of "domain experts" was larger than the cohort of ElPs for CRC for both surgeons (63 vs. 154) and pathologists (6 vs. 154)., DISCUSSION: In this population study, we identified EIPs for CRC using the Hiss method, although significantly more surgical than pathology EIPs for CRC were recognized. The educational influence of domain experts who do not fulfill the Hiss characteristics compared with EIPs for CRC remains to be determined.

N1  - Comment in: Clin Med (Lond). 2005 Jan-Feb;5(1):84; PMID: 15745213
N2  - The clinical competence of doctors needs to be defined and assessed in relation to the circumstances of individual practice, in terms of knowledge and skills, both clinical and communicative, as well as attitudes and behaviour. The need to identify the role of the medical practitioner in the context of team working is important and this position requires the skills of diagnosis, synthesis of information and prioritisation of investigation and treatment. Completion of training and acquisition of the Certificate of Completion of Specialist Training (CCST) lead to inclusion in the Specialist Register thus defining the specialist; elevation of a specialist to consultant status in the NHS requires the potential to acquire with maturity, both of person and experience, the confidence to take responsibilities for handling difficult situations, to manage uncertainties in clinical encounters and to guide younger doctors in their careers.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Today's complex health care environment coupled with the 80-hour workweek mandate has required that surgical resident team interactions evolve from a military command-and-control style to a collaborative leadership style., METHODS: A novel educational curriculum was implemented with objectives of training the residents to have the capacity/ability to create and manage powerful teams through alignment, communication, and integrity integral tools to practicing a collaborative leadership style while working 80 hours per week. Specific strategies were as follows: (1) to focus on quality of patient care and service while receiving a high education-to-service ratio, and (2) to maximize efficiency through time management., RESULTS: This article shows that leadership training as part of a resident curriculum can significantly increase a resident's view of leadership in the areas of alignment, communication, and integrity; tools previously shown in business models to be vital for effective and efficient teams., CONCLUSION: This curriculum, over the course of the surgical residency, can provide residents with the necessary tools to deliver efficient quality of care while working within the 80-hour workweek mandate in a more collaborative style environment.

Y1  - 2004//
N2  - Despite many efforts to increase access to end-of-life care, culturally diverse groups are still not being served. Interviews of 22 hospice and palliative care program directors in one southeastern state indicated that directors overestimated how well programs are doing in meeting the needs of diverse groups but were very interested in implementing cultural diversity training for their staff Those who were more concerned about such issues had recruited more diverse volunteers into their programs. The presence of diverse staff or volunteers predicted a more diverse patient population. A number of efforts were underway to develop cultural competence and provide culturally competent care. Several directors reported no efforts in this direction, however Directors described programmatic barriers and resources needed. The authors concluded that directors should provide leadership in their agencies in welcoming diversity. Implications for further research and work within the larger end-of-life care field are discussed.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this project was to develop a seminar on women as leaders within an academic department of psychiatry and to evaluate its effectiveness., METHODS: A seminar was offered as an elective to all residents within the Yale University Department of Psychiatry. Didactic presentations and open discussion were structured around the following topics: 1) exploration of leadership roles in various areas, including research, clinical practice, teaching, and administration; 2) organizational dynamics and gender; 3) negotiation skills and conflict resolution strategies; 4) role of consultation, seminars, peer support and mentoring by both men and women in the development of leadership skills; and 5) "keeping the balance: work, relationships, and personal health." The 13 participants were queried at the completion of the seminar, and a follow-up survey was performed 18 months later., RESULTS: The initial and follow-up evaluations were quite positive, with average ratings in the "excellent" range at both points. The 10 respondents at 18 months were unanimous that there had been a positive and lasting effect on their professional lives., CONCLUSION: A seminar on women as leaders was a successful venture within an academic department of psychiatry. The structure of the course, which incorporated specific teaching materials plus "local" expertise, could serve as a model for such seminars in other programs or could be integrated into an existing course for all residents.

N2  - The Association of University Professors of Neurology and the American Neurologic Association surveyed the leaders of academic neurology programs in the United States to assess the current financial health of academic neurology. The survey, completed in late 2002, addressed program relations with hospitals and medical schools and the effects of financial pressures on program operations, clinical responsibilities, research, teaching, and faculty development. Response patterns suggest academic neurology is challenged on several levels and indicate a need for strategic reflection and focused research to better gauge the state of neurology in the United States and to develop solutions for program survival and evolution.

Y1  - 2004//
N2  - Research regarding the development of healthcare leadership competencies is widely available. However, minimal research has been published regarding the development of physician leadership competencies, despite growing recognition in recent years of the important need for effective physician leadership. Usingdata from an electronically distributed, self-administered survey, the authors examined the perceptions held by 110 physician leaders, physician educators, and medical students regarding the extent to which nine competencies are important for effective physician leadership, ten activities are indicative of physician leadership, and seven methods are effective for the development of physician leadership competencies. Results indicated that "interpersonal and communication skills" and "professional ethics and social responsibility" are perceived as the most important competencies for effective physician leadership. Furthermore, respondents believe "influencing peers to adopt new approaches in medicine" and "administrative responsibility in a healthcare organization" are the activities most indicative of effective physician leadership. Finally, respondents perceive"coaching or mentoring from an experienced leader" and "on-job experience (e.g., a management position)" as the most effective methods for developing physician leadership competencies. The implications of these findings for the education and development of physician leaders are discussed.

Y1  - 2004//
N2  - Reproductive and sexual health (RSH) education is a key component of most family planning programs around the world and is particularly important for adolescents, for whom parenthood is more likely to have difficult or dangerous health outcomes. A lack of comprehensive RSH education targeted at adolescents may augment the poor outcomes associated with early pregnancy by creating barriers to optimal care. This article discusses the creation of the Centro de Medicina Reproductiva y Desarrollo Integral de la Adolescencia clinic, a comprehensive adolescent reproductive health center in Santiago de Chile, and its RSH education programs. In particular, the role of the physician in originating and leading the RSH education efforts, the controversy associated with RSH education in Chile, and the effects of comprehensive RHS education on the local and regional adolescent populations are discussed.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this report is to describe and evaluate the impact of a 1-day retreat focused on developing leadership skills and teambuilding among postgraduate year 1 residents in an internal medicine residency., METHOD: A group of organizers, including members of the staff, the chief medical residents, administrative individuals in the residency office, and an internal organizational development consultant convened to organize an off-site retreat with activities that would provide experiential learning regarding teamwork and leadership, including a "reef survival exercise" and table discussions regarding the characteristics of ideal leaders. In addition, several energizing activities and recreational free time was provided to enhance the interaction and teamwork dimensions of the retreat. To evaluate the impact of the retreat, attendees completed baseline and follow-up questionnaires regarding their experience of the retreat., RESULTS: Attendees universally regarded the retreat as having value for them. Comparison of baseline to postretreat responses indicated that attendees felt that the retreat enhanced their abilities to be better physicians, resident supervisors, and leaders. Follow-up responses indicated significant increases in attendees' agreement that good leaders challenge the process, make decisions based on shared visions, allow others to act, recognize individual contributions, and serve as good role models. Results on the survival exercise indicated a high frequency with which team-based decisions surpassed individual members' decisions, highlighting the importance and value of teamwork to attendees., CONCLUSIONS: Our main findings were that: participants universally found this 1-day retreat beneficial in helping to develop teamwork and leadership skills and the experiential learning aspects of the retreat were more especially highly rated and highlighted the advantages of teamwork. In the context that this 1-day retreat was deemed useful by faculty and residents alike, further study is needed to assess the impact of this learning on actual clinical practice and the durability of these lessons.

T1  - Individual and organizational well-being of female physicians--an assessment of three different management programs.

Y1  - 2004//
N2  - Abstract Management programs have become a popular method to develop future leaders. There is, however, a lack of controlled studies assessing the long-term effects of such programs on participants' career development, organizational influence, and mental and physical well-being. The aim of this prospective, controlled study was to assess the possible impact from 3 different structured management development programs on the individual and organizational well-being of female physicians. One year after the end of the 1-year intervention program, the intervention group reported statistically significant improvements in ratings of organizational influence, management feed back, perception of the organizational leadership, contact with one's immediate supervisor, and personal skills development as compared with the reference group. There were no statistically significant differences, however, between the groups with regard to individual health and well-being or career development. These results give rise to many questions, both concerning the effects of these 3 management programs and the career possibilities for female physicians.

T1  - Resident-Assisted Montessori Programming (RAMP): training persons with dementia to serve as group activity leaders.
A1  - Camp, Cameron J
A1  - Skrajner, Michael J
Y1  - 2004//
N2  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of an activity implemented by means of Resident-Assisted Montessori Programming (RAMP)., DESIGN AND METHODS: Four persons with early-stage dementia were trained to serve as leaders for a small-group activity played by nine persons with more advanced dementia. Assessments of leaders' ability to learn the procedures of leading a group, as well as their satisfaction with this role, were taken, as were measures of players' engagement and affect during standard activities programming and RAMP activities., RESULTS: Leaders demonstrated the potential to fill the role of group activity leader effectively, and they expressed a high level of satisfaction with this role. Players' levels of positive engagement and pleasure during the RAMP activity were higher than during standard group activities., IMPLICATIONS: This study suggests that to the extent that procedural learning is available to persons with early-stage dementia, especially when they are assisted with external cueing, these individuals can successfully fill the role of volunteers when working with persons with more advanced dementia. This can provide a meaningful social role for leaders and increase access to high quality activities programming for large numbers of persons with dementia.Copyright 2004 The Gerontological Society of America

T1  - Strengthening the fellowship training experience: findings from a national survey of fellowship trained geriatricians 1990-1998.
A1  - Medina-Walpole, Annette
A1  - Barker, William H
A1  - Katz, Paul R
Y1  - 2004//
N2  - Geriatric fellowship training has significantly advanced in the past 2 decades in number, organization, and accreditation of formal fellowship programs. A recent survey examined career decision-making, fellowship training, and current professional activities of fellowship trained geriatricians. This paper focuses upon further desired fellowship training identified by these individuals. The responses reflect skills relevant to four aspects of professional performance: administration, management, clinical geriatrics, research, and education. More than half of the respondents documented the need for increased training in administration, including long-term care medical directorship and Medicare/managed care. Regarding clinical training, 66% recommended additional subspecialty training, particularly in psychiatry, neurology, rehabilitation, and hospice/palliative care. Seventeen percent identified a need for training in research methodology, grant writing, and mentorship. Some 6% indicated a need for further training in education, citing teaching skills and program/faculty development. This article provides examples of opportunities to strengthen each of the four defined areas, including formal training in medical administration by the American Medical Director's Association, model strategies for incorporating subspecialties, hospice/palliative care, programs to pursue graduate level training in research at many universities, and faculty development programs such as those offered by Harvard and Stanford. Accredited geriatric fellowship programs as well as fellows should recognize potential gaps in training, and make available opportunities to strengthen these areas critical to preparing for future careers in geriatric medicine.

T1  - The emergency department medical director as supervisor of medical professionals.
A1  - Vidrine, Lawrence R
Y1  - 2004//
N2  - The overall success of the ED in the eyes of its customers demands the successful performance of a complex operation involving a team of skilled professionals from various disciplines interacting with support staff and the public. The strong personalities, intelligence, and training of emergency physicians provides the medical director significant challenges as their supervisor. The ED medical staff provides a great impact on the culture and overall perceived performance of the department. It is essential that their leader provide clear direction regarding the performance expectations of the organization for the medical staff. A systematic approach to developing and expressing those expectations, providing timely feedback regarding performance to those expectations, and addressing variation from expectations can provide a valuable tool in supporting the ED medical director's success. This article has been a brief overview of the basic components ofa performance management system for physicians. It has described a process for arriving at explicit performance expectations across dimensions commonly associated with a medical practice, an approach to measuring critical performance factors and delivering ongoing routine feedback to individuals and the group regarding performance to expectations. Finally, it addressed important steps to include in the management of marginal and exceptional performers to preserve the functional integrity and long-term success of the ED. In adopting this approach to the supervisory responsibilities of the medical director, a strong foundation is established for successful performance management.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Traditionally, development of physician leadership has occurred at random in surgical training. One possible reason is that surgical educators have focused on detailed instruction on critical patient situations, resuscitation, and technical skills, but they have provided little formal training in the essential leadership skills., METHODS: To determine resident perceptions about the importance of these skills and individual strengths and weaknesses in these areas, a questionnaire was administered to 43 residents in our general surgery program. In part one of the questionnaire, the residents ranked 18 leadership skills on a scale of 1 to 4 in importance ("not important," "minimally important," "somewhat important," and "very important") for career development. The second portion of the questionnaire asked the residents to rate themselves on a similar scale with regard to their personal confidence and competence in these same areas., RESULTS: Twenty-three residents (53%) completed the entire questionnaire. The majority of the residents (92%) rated all 18 leadership skills "somewhat" or "very important" for career development. More than 50% of the residents rated themselves as not competent or minimally competent in 10 of the 18 areas. Ethics was the only area in which >75% of the residents believed themselves to be more than minimally competent. There were no significant differences between postgraduate training levels in any of the parameters calculated., CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that although residents see these nontraditional topics as an important part of their professional education, they do not necessarily feel confident or competent in these areas. Establishing a conscious effort to teach these topics and to emphasize their importance during training will enhance residents' self-image, performance, and potential as future leaders.

Y1  - 2004//
N2  - OBJECTIVE: To test an intervention to enhance collaborative communication among nurse and physician leaders (eg, nurse manager, medical director, clinical nurse specialist) in two diverse intensive care units (ICUs)., BACKGROUND: Collaborative communication is associated with positive patient, nurse, and physician outcomes. However, to date, intervention-focused research that seeks to improve collaborative communication is lacking., METHODS: A pretest-posttest repeated measures design incorporated baseline data collection, implementation of the intervention over 8 months, and immediate and 6-months-post data collection., FINDINGS: Communication skills of ICU nurse and physician leaders improved significantly. Leaders also reported increased satisfaction with their own communication and leadership skills. In addition, staff nurse and physician perceptions of nursing leadership and problem solving between groups increased. Staff nurses reported lower personal stress (eg, more respect from co-workers, physicians, and managers), even though they perceived significantly more situational stress (eg, less staffing and time)., CONCLUSION: Study findings provide evidence that nurse-physician collaborative communication can be improved.

T1  - Executive skills for medical faculty: a workshop description and evaluation.
A1  - Steinert, Yvonne

Y1  - 2003//
N2  - As the healthcare system continues to change, healthcare professionals will need to assume an increasing number of administrative and management responsibilities. The goal of this article is to describe a two-day workshop on Executive Skills for Medical Faculty and the results of an evaluation conducted one year later. This workshop consisted of specific modules on analyzing time-management skills, determining goals and priorities, improving time-management strategies, assessing leadership styles and skills, and conducting effective meetings. The workshop evaluation consisted of an immediate post-workshop questionnaire administered to all of the participants, and semi-structured interviews, conducted on the telephone, with half of the attendees. Both evaluations were designed to assess perceptions of the workshop's usefulness and areas of individual change. Feedback from the participants immediately after the workshop indicated an overall satisfaction with the workshop content and methodology and a desire to try new time-management strategies. Evaluation of the workshop one year later indicated that the majority of the participants had determined their priorities more clearly, altered their time-management strategies, and planned more effective meetings. Less change was noted in the area of leadership styles and skills. Both the immediate and delayed workshop evaluations indicated that the most useful sessions were those devoted to determining goals and priorities, time management and effective meetings. These results suggest that a two-day workshop can improve health care professionals' administrative and management skills in certain areas. A longer workshop and built-in 'follow-up' activities would enhance the potential for change.

T1  - Physician leadership: influence on practice-based learning and improvement.
A1  - Prather, Stephen E
A1  - Jones, David N
Y1  - 2003//
N2  - In response to the technology and information explosion, practice-based learning and improvement is emerging within the medical field to deliver systematic practice-linked improvements. However, its emergence has been inhibited by the slow acceptance of evidence-based medicine among physicians, who are reluctant to embrace proven high-performance leadership principles long established in other high-risk fields. This reluctance may be attributable to traditional medical training, which encourages controlling leadership styles that magnify the resistance common to all change efforts. To overcome this resistance, physicians must develop the same leadership skills that have proven to be critical to success in other service and high-performance industries. Skills such as self-awareness, shared authority, conflict resolution, and nonpunitive critique can emerge in practice only if they are taught. A dramatic shift away from control and blame has become a requirement for achieving success in other industries based on complex group process. This approach is so mainstream that the burden of proof that cooperative leadership is not a requirement for medical improvement falls to those institutions perpetuating the outmoded paradigm of the past. Cooperative leadership skills that have proven central to implementing change in the information era are suggested as a core cultural support for practice-based learning and improvement. Complex adaptive systems theory, long used as a way to understand evolutionary biology, and more recently computer science and economics, predicts that behavior emerging among some groups of providers will be selected for duplication by the competitive environment. A curriculum framework needed to teach leadership skills to expand the influence of practice-based learning and improvement is offered as a guide to accelerate change.

T1  - Leadership development: prerequisite for successful public-private partnership. New challenge for medical schools: graduates' outcome competences in health leadership.
A1  - Wojtczak, Andrzej
Y1  - 2003//
N2  - Medical education stands at the doorstep of profound change, forced to step into an uncertain and potentially hostile new environment. These changes have nothing to do with scholar self-reflection, but rather are a direct consequence of the process of globalization visible also in medical education and the revolution in health care financing for which we use the general term "managed care". On one hand, globalization has penetrated different areas of our life, among others including science, public health and medicine which is a global profession. Medical knowledge, research and education have traditionally crossed national boundaries. Many aptitudes of physicians are universal, as well as the core competencies required by physicians throughout the world. The question is "what kind of core or essential competences are required for "global physicians". Besides medical knowledge and basic clinical skills, professionalism, interpersonal communication skills, context of care, information management, understanding a health system, etc. also need to be addressed. On the other hand, there is a growing concern that the corporate transformation of medical care, especially related to the impact of the changing and more business-oriented health care system, may lead to the decline and death of traditional professional values, such as fidelity, altruism, confidentiality, and integrity. No doubt, there is an inherent clash of values between business and medicine. However, as business interests have already gained an important place in medicine, we can hope that physicians progressively adopt a business mentality without losing professional virtue. While occurring changes inevitably bring some sense of loss, it also brings an opportunity to help reshape medical education to better meet the health needs of society.

N2  - CONTEXT: Most graduates of rural residencies enter rural practice. Rural residencies therefore have emerged over the past 2 decades to increase the supply of rural physicians. However, researchers have published few descriptions of strategies to evaluate and select communities in which to locate rural residencies., PURPOSE: This report describes the development and application of such a strategy to assess 7 rural communities in Utah as potential sites for family practice residency training., METHODS: Criteria were developed on the basis of an examination of the literature, residency accreditation requirements, and characteristics of existing rural residency programs. Ten rural or frontier communities with hospitals were selected as study candidates, and 7 agreed to participate. Data were collected through hospital surveys, state hospital discharge records, and community site visits., FINDINGS: Specific evaluation criteria that were developed included the presence of a medical practice of the appropriate specialty and size, a sufficient number of medical subspecialty physicians, an adequate number and mix of hospitalized patients, an adequate number of ambulatory patients, adequate outpatient facility space to accommodate learners, and a commitment by the practicing physician and hospital to lead the program and teach residents. Two communities were found to be potentially capable of supporting a residency if physicians and hospital leaders in the communities were to become motivated to lead program development., CONCLUSIONS: These criteria may be useful in other states, but they have not been tested for validity or reliability and are subject to limitations such as exclusion of alternate rural residency models. Future research should address data needs and the relationship of the evaluation criteria to the quality of resident learning.

Y1  - 2003//
N2  - The purpose of this study was to 1) describe the structure of the oral health program in a university-affiliated hospital; 2) evaluate staff's knowledge and attitudes toward oral health; and 3) propose ways to strengthen the incorporation of oral health prevention for children into clinical medical education. Qualitative methods were used to evaluate the program. Structured interviews with seventeen medical center personnel were conducted, and clinic utilization reports provided ICD-9 diagnostic frequency and visits. Clinic staff, pediatric residents, dental and pediatric faculty, hospital administrators, and clinic directors were interviewed. The themes identified during these interviews were motivation, roles, operational and organizational issues, and integration into the larger medical care system. Integration of an early childhood caries prevention program into the clinical medical education curriculum can be accomplished. After implementation of the oral health program described in this paper, dental caries became the eleventh most common diagnosis seen in the clinic when previously it did not appear in the top forty. However, institutional and organizational barriers are significant. Barriers identified were 1) lack of clarity in defining leadership and roles regarding oral health, 2) time and work overload in a busy pediatric clinic, 3) a tracking system was not available to quickly determine which children needed caries prevention procedures and education, and 4) billing and medical record form changes could not be fully established prior to starting the program.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The surgical mind is geared to make important decisions and perform highly skilled tasks. The aim of this review is to explore the cognitive processes that link these actions., METHODS: The core of this review is derived from a literature search of a computer database (Medline)., RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The surgical image is one of action. However, the effective performance of surgery requires more than mere manual dexterity and it is evident that competent surgeons exhibit the cognitive traits that are held by all experts. The changes that are occurring in surgery indicate a need to place greater emphasis on the cognitive processes that underpin the practice of surgery. It is important that surgeons do not become victims of their own cult image.Copyright 2002 British Journal of Surgery Society Ltd. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

N2  - The U.S. Institute of Medicine in its 1998 review of the health care systems among the U.S.-Associated Pacific Islands (USAPI) identified promotion of primary health care (PHC) and training of the regional health workforce including postgraduate training for physicians as priorities. With the support of the health leadership of the USAPI and the Republic of Palau, the John A. Burns School of Medicine (JABSOM) of the University of Hawaii captured U.S. federal Area Health Education Center (AHEC) funds to implement a postgraduate program to train Family Practitioners - physician specialists in primary care for the region. The Palau AHEC has evolved into ajoint activity of JABSOM, the University of Auckland Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences (UAFMHS), the School of Public Health & Primary Care--Fiji School of Medicine, and Palau Community College to provide Diploma-level training in Family Practice and Community Health for Micronesian physicians.

T1  - Who would become a successful Dean of Faculty of Medicine: academic or clinician or administrator?.
A1  - Lee, Albert
A1  - Hoyle, Eric
Y1  - 2002//
N2  - It has been a long tradition that the medical school dean is an expert in a specialist field with a well-established reputation in research and clinical services. Medical education is no longer simply disease orientated; it is required to put an emphasis on prevention, the need for better management of the health care system, and the need for a better understanding of the sociopolitical aspects of medical care. The deans of medical schools must appreciate the social role of medical education, and the social contract with the community. Although doctors might have difficulties with leadership because they are trained to work as individuals and to value highly their independence and autonomy, good communication skills are an asset for clinicians in management roles. It does not matter whether the background of the dean is academic, clinical or administrative; the most important thing is to possess the managerial skills to tackle the three-way tension between management, academic leadership and professional leadership. The job should be open to people with a good knowledge of and background in health and fiscal expertise, and also a high degree of management, diplomatic and interpersonal skills. Those skills should also be emphasized in the medical curriculum.

T1  - 'The second greatest benefit to mankind'?.
A1  - Chantler, Cyril
Y1  - 2002//
N2  - In 1739 Samuel Johnson wrote an essay on the life of Dr Hermann Boerhaave, Professor of Physic at the University of Leiden, who died in 1738. Boerhaave, born 11 years after Harvey's death, could be said to have been influenced by Harvey in that he favoured experimental natural philosophy as the gateway to scientific medicine. He was denied entry into the church because he was accused wrongly of being a follower of the philosopher Baruch Spinoza, regarded as a heretic because he criticised established religious practices; this in spite of strongly supporting the love of God and humanity. Boerhaave decided to become a physician as he was, in Johnson's words, 'equally qualified for a profession, not indeed of equal dignity or importance, but which must undoubtedly claim the second place amongst those which are the greatest benefit to mankind'. It is this claim that I wish to examine. Can we still claim this regard for our profession? Is the medicine we practise, and the way we practise, of the greatest benefit to mankind, and how do we ensure that it is?

Using examples from the Veterans Affairs National Quality Scholars Fellowship Program, they describe how these factors were used successfully. While not the only steps to take, these critical success factors proved helpful in defining the problem to be addressed, engaging leadership, and anticipating the resolution of conflict.

T1  - Excellence in role modelling: insight and perspectives from the pros.
A1  - Wright, Scott M
A1  - Carrese, Joseph A
Y1  - 2002//
N2  - BACKGROUND: Role modelling is an effective teaching method in medical education. We sought to better understand role modelling by examining the insights of respected physician role models., METHODS: We conducted 30-minute in-depth interviews with 29 highly regarded role models at 2 large teaching hospitals. We coded the transcripts independently, and compared our coding for agreement. Content analysis identified several major categories of themes., RESULTS: The informants identified specific characteristics related to role modelling. Subcategories under the domain of personal qualities included interpersonal skills, a positive outlook, a commitment to excellence and growth, integrity and leadership. Under the domain of teaching, the subcategories were establishing rapport with learners, developing specific teaching philosophies and methods, and being committed to the growth of learners. Subjects thought there was some overlap between teaching and role modelling, but felt that the latter was more implicit and more encompassing. Being a strong clinician was regarded as necessary but not sufficient for being an exemplary physician role model. Perceived barriers to effective role modelling included being impatient and overly opinionated, being quiet, being overextended, and having difficulty remembering names and faces. Physician role models described role modeling consciousness, in that they specifically think about being role models when interacting with learners. Subjects believed that medical learners should emulate multiple role models., INTERPRETATION: Highly regarded physician role models possess personal qualities, teaching abilities and exceptional clinical skills that outweigh their own barriers to serving as effective role models. Many of these positive attributes of role models represent behaviours that can be modified or skills that can be acquired.

Y1  - 2002//
N2  - INTRODUCTION: Educationally influential physicians may be a valuable resource in continuing medical education. Although the idea driving this research--informal learning--converges with research in adult education, organizational learning, marketing, and knowledge diffusion, the results of interventions have proven inconclusive. To actualize the promise of the educationally influential physician (EIP) construct, it is argued that researchers must return to the "classic" studies in this area and resume the process of validating the meaning of the construct., METHODS: A literature review and the occasion of an educationally influential physician identification survey provided an opportunity to contribute to development of this construct. We compared three identification rules used to study 212 physicians., RESULTS: Each rule may identify different people as EIPs., DISCUSSION: To improve the use of educational influentials, research must be completed to validate their role in informal learning.

T1  - Preparing for an era of weapons of mass destruction (WMD). Are we there yet? Why we should all be concerned. Part 1.
A1  - McFee, Robin B
Y1  - 2002//
N2  - In the aftermath of September 11th and autumn 2001, tremendous efforts have been expended to enhance national preparedness to protect against terrorism and weapons of mass destruction (WMD). However there remain significant vulnerabilities across domains, including communications, health care facility preparedness, professional training, interagency collaborations, public health infrastructure, surveillance capabilities, the food supply, the environment and resource allocation. It is a significant challenge to prepare for an unknown event, without a clear-cut indicator of who to protect and from whom. The daunting tasks of preparing a nation, remedyingyears of under-investment in public health, and promoting cooperative endeavors among agencies unaccustomed to working together cannot be solved merely by money, brief overview training programs, and quick fixes. None the less, much progress has been made and hope is on the horizon. Although it would seem obvious to include toxicologists in WMD planning, often this is not the case. What role should the poison control and toxicology communities play? What follows is the first of a two-part discussion of our current state of WMD preparedness and the vulnerabilities we must address. Part 2 will examine possible solutions and discuss the critical leadership role toxicology can play in this important arena.

N2  - This education strategy was used at a 404-bed level-one trauma center where 60% of the beds are for critical care. In June 1999, 93 nurses underwent critical care orientation. By June 2000, only 8 of these nurses remained. Exit interviews revealed the primary reason for leaving was dissatisfaction with orientation. The Education Department undertook a shared leadership approach to identify strategies for resolution of the perceived orientation problem. The Preceptor Leadership Council was formed to create a Nurse Residency Program for new nurses. Membership consisted of staff nurse lead preceptors and clinical educators. Outcomes following the implementation of the program indicated an overall increase in satisfaction with nursing orientation in the intensive care unit as well as a significant reduction in turnover rates. Strategies used to create, implement, and evaluate the program are presented.

T1  - Clinical program leadership: skill requirements for contemporary leaders.
A1  - Spallina, Joseph M
Y1  - 2002//
N2  - With knowledge of these leadership requirements and a shrinking base of experienced managers, healthcare organizations and professional societies have little choice in their approach to prepare for the leadership development challenges of the future. Organizations will focus leadership development, training, and continuing management education on integrating business tools and skills into clinical program management. The management requirements for clinical programs will continue to grow in complexity and the number of qualified managers will continue to diminish, New approaches to solving this shortage will evolve. Professional, forprofit companies, healthcare provider organizations, and academic programs will develop clinical program management training tracks. Organizations that create solutions to this management imperative will maintain their competitive edge in the challenging times that will greet the industry in the future.

Y1  - 2002//
N2  - BACKGROUND: The role of residency program director is unique in medicine and medical education. Most program directors learn the job through trial and error, with a fortunate few benefiting from the wisdom and experience of their predecessors and mentors. In 1994, the Association of Family Practice Residency Directors (AFPRD) made the development of training and support resources for program directors a top priority., METHODS: With the support of the strategic plan of the AFPRD, the focus on excellence in residency education by the ABFP, and a survey documenting need, the National Institute for Program Director Development (NIPDD) was formed, with its sentinel product, a school for family practice residency directors., RESULTS: A fellowship-format 9-month training program was constructed using a multidimensional educational model. To date, there have been more than 300 participants. The curriculum emphasizes leadership development, resource allocation, a thorough familiarity with regulations and standards, educational options, and personnel management skills. A follow-up survey in 1999 documented an increase in program director tenure and an overall positive impact on family practice residency programs., CONCLUSIONS: Enhanced preparation for the job of residency program director results in a positive impact on both the director and the program.

T1  - A data-based agenda for doctoral nursing education reform.
A1  - Minnick, Ann F
A1  - Halstead, Lois A
Y1  - 2002//
N2  - BACKGROUND: Continuing concerns over the diverse degree names and the quality and quantity of doctoral nursing programs make it essential that nursing leadership take consensus-driven action on the basis of today's educational realities., PURPOSE: To explore the state of US doctoral nursing education to determine what leadership initiatives are needed in program definition, scope, and resources., METHOD: The researchers used a mailed survey (63.4% response rate) and Web site review (all remaining progress) to gather data on all US doctoral nursing education programs (n = 87). The survey included 12 items pertaining to each degree program and 11 institutional environmental questions., DISCUSSION: The doctor of philosophy was the most common degree title (n = 71). Degree title was not consistently associated with requirements (eg, dissertation and practica requirements) or stated degree purposes. Reports of program resources, as defined by faculty rank and research experience, indicated fiscal and educational threats to program integrity in many schools., CONCLUSIONS: Although individual schools should continue efforts to increase educational quality, consensus and action by all doctoral programs is needed. Five recommendations for immediate action are proposed.

T1  - Are psychiatrists equipped for management roles in mental health services?.

Y1  - 2002//
N1  - Comment in: Aust N Z J Psychiatry. 2003 Aug;37(4):492-3; PMID: 12873336
N2  - OBJECTIVES: To promote the discussion of leadership and management skills development among psychiatrists in Australia and New Zealand., METHOD: A key informant survey of fellows of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists was conducted via a semi-structured interview. This canvassed views about leadership and management issues including levels of confidence and needs for additional skills., RESULTS: There was widespread support for psychiatrists to be in management roles in mental health services; however, on entering management positions, psychiatrists often felt inadequately trained and prepared for their new role. Furthermore, many who had made the transition to management perceived a lack of support from their clinical colleagues. Clinicians appeared to believe that management was not difficult to learn and could be done by any experienced clinician. The provision of short courses and mentoring programmes is the preferred option for most psychiatrists seeking to acquire leadership and management skills., CONCLUSIONS: For psychiatrists to maximize their potential as leaders in Australian and New Zealand mental health services, greater attention to promoting the acquisition of relevant skills throughout training and in the post-fellowship years is required. Psychiatrists need to be supported and encouraged to pursue further education, training and research in this area. Failure to address this issue risks psychiatrists continuing to feel disadvantaged in management roles and hence reluctant to undertake the challenge.

Y1  - 2001//
N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In 1990, the first and, to date, only objective study of Balint groups in US family practice residencies was conducted to measure their prevalence, composition, leadership, and function. The study reported here collected similar information about Balint groups., METHODS: Surveys were sent to all 464 US family practice residency program directors, with a 1-month follow-up to nonrespondents. The survey included questions about the existence, leadership, meeting frequency, and objectives of Balint training., RESULTS: A total of 298 (64%) residencies responded. Almost half (48%) of US responding residences reported conducting Balint groups, and 40% of those residencies have more than one group. The frequency of Balint group meetings has shifted in the past 10 years. In 1990, 55% of groups met weekly; in 2000, only 15% of groups met weekly. Sixty-five percent of residencies require Balint participation. One third of Balint groups are conducted without a coleader and the number of physicians leading groups is 22%, a decrease of 10% from 10 years ago. Forty-four percent of groups are led by psychologists, an increase of 19% from 10 years ago. Respondents indicated uncertainly about whether their groups were true Balint groups or simply resident support groups., CONCLUSIONS: About half of US family practice residencies operate groups described as Balint groups. They meet less frequently then 10 years ago and are less likely to have a physician involved in group leadership. Some of the groups may actually be support groups rather than Balint groups.

N2  - The results of a national panel survey of physician leaders are presented here. Although these perspectives are not drawn from a random national sample of all physician leaders, they do provide valuable insight from a group of key decision makers. Current technical and skill areas applicable to medical leadership, and projected future needs, are addressed. While medical leadership at present is focused on clinical medicine, perceptions of future directions for medical leadership suggests the increasing need for education related to specific technical skills as well as enhancement of personal characteristics.

N2  - In this J. Roland Folse Invited Lecture in Surgical Education, given before the Association for Surgical Education, a resident considers two challenges for surgery and surgical training: the increasing importance of less invasive technologies, and the growing awareness of the importance of "systems" in care. As less invasive technologies evolve, the role of surgeons is being fundamentally challenged. Two alternative models of adaptation to technological change exist: the breast surgery model, in which surgeons restrict their role to providing open operative interventions, versus the neurosurgery model, in which surgeons adopt even noninvasive technologies in order to continue to manage diseases that might need open intervention. The neurosurgery model appears preferable but poses difficulties for the existing structure of surgical training. Evidence that surgical outcomes are critically dependent on entire teams of personnel, and not merely individual surgeons, may require changes in surgical training, as well.

N2  - Women are persistently underrepresented in the higher levels of academic administration despite the fact that they have been entering the medical profession in increasing numbers for at least 20 years and now make up a large proportion of the medical student body and fill a similar proportion of entry level positions in medical schools. Although there are no easy remedies for gender inequities in medical schools, strategies have been proposed and implemented both within academic institutions and more broadly to achieve and sustain the advancement of women faculty to senior level positions. Substantial, sustained efforts to increase programs and activities addressing the major obstacles to advancement of women must be put in place so that the contributions of women can be fully realized and their skills fittingly applied in meeting the medical education and healthcare needs of all people in the 21st century.

N2  - Meaningful examination of program outcomes is one of the most challenging tasks facing faculty and administrators involved in the design and delivery of educational programs. This article reports the outcomes for one doctoral program in nursing and elucidates salient conceptual and methodologic issues in educational outcomes research for this discipline. Career development, scholarly productivity, and professional leadership were the foci of this outcomes study. Three instruments were used; data were provided by alumni, graduate faculty, and alumni supervisors. Data analysis techniques included content analysis and descriptive and correlational statistics. Results showed that graduates embarked on diverse career paths with the majority employed in academic institutions. Most graduates reported active involvement in research, publications, presentations, and professional leadership. Employment pattern differences were noted between academic year and summer-only program graduates with associated divergence in career emphasis, research productivity, and job satisfaction. A positive correlation of time since degree conferral with scholarly productivity and professional leadership was noted. Recommendations for future research include refining outcomes, linking process to outcome, using longitudinal designs, and attending to unique nursing student and doctoral program characteristics.

T1  - Investment in a rural residency program: a case study.
A1  - Catalano, R A
Y1  - 2000//
N2  - Rural hospitals have used numerous strategies over the past several decades to recruit and retain physicians. These have included providing physicians economic incentives, immigration status, professional and technical support and establishing rural training tracks (RTT) in family practice residency programs. This paper presents the experience of an isolated rural region in southwestern New York state that has employed each of these strategies in the past decade. Success as measured by the change in size of the medical staff, hospital operating margins, admissions and employment occurred only after the emphasis changed from meeting hospital needs to physician needs. Pivotal to this strategy was the nurturing and development of an RTT. Investment in the residency program required strong leadership to ensure the political, financial and operational commitment of its affiliated hospital. In addition, the RTT required an affiliation with a financially viable, full-service hospital, a strong on-site chief of service, family physicians who performed cesarean sections, midlevel providers and practitioners dedicated to the mission of teaching.

N2  - The National Association of Physicians for the Environment (NAPE) has assumed a leadership role in protecting environmental health in recent years. The Committee of Biomedical Research Leaders was convened at the recent NAPE Leadership Conference: Biomedical Research and the Environment held on 1--2 November 1999, at the National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland. This report summarizes the discussion of the committee and its recommendations. The charge to the committee was to raise and address issues that will promote and sustain environmental health, safety, and energy efficiency within the biomedical community. Leaders from every important research sector (industry laboratories, academic health centers and institutes, hospitals and care facilities, Federal laboratories, and community-based research facilities) were gathered in this committee to discuss issues relevant to promoting environmental health. The conference and this report focus on the themes of environmental stewardship, sustainable development and "best greening practices." Environmental stewardship, an emerging theme within and outside the biomedical community, symbolizes the effort to provide an integrated, synthesized, and concerted effort to protect the health of the environment in both the present and the future. The primary goal established by the committee is to promote environmentally responsible leadership in the biomedical research community. Key outcomes of the committee's discussion and deliberation were a) the need for a central organization to evaluate, promote, and oversee efforts in environmental stewardship; and b) immediate need to facilitate efficient information transfer relevant to protecting the global environment through a database/clearinghouse. Means to fulfill these needs are discussed in this report.

N2  - A gender perspective on health and consultation is part of medical education today. Teaching about gender must not focus on differences between men and women as essential, biological, and unchangeable. The meaning of "feminine" and "masculine" is largely a social construction, i.e. the behavior and character of an individual are seldom determined by sex. Furthermore, women and men live under different conditions and have different positions in society. Medical students need to be aware of this and reflect upon the influence it may have on their professional role and practice. To achieve this awareness, knowledge about the construction of gender is needed. This article reviews relevant research in this field. The gender of the physician is used as a basis and illustration of this.

T1  - Physician leadership is essential to the survival of teaching hospitals.

Y1  - 2000//
N2  - BACKGROUND: Academic medical centers (AMCs) face severe financial constraints because they must now compete directly with private providers that focus exclusively on cost-effective healthcare delivery. Educational and research capacities developed at AMCs have been supported by government and third party payers, but government support is diminishing. Physicians are ill-equipped to respond to market pressures., DATA SOURCES: Analyses of cultural change and restructuring in corporate giants such as Greyhound, IBM and FedEx are relevant to teaching hospitals. To succeed, organizations must flatten hierarchy, empower staff, train leaders, and mobilize intellectual capital. Effective leadership is essential., CONCLUSION: Physicians must educate themselves on forces impacting the AMC, understand changes needed in the structure and processes of AMC governance and acquire competencies for leadership and management if AMCs are to survive and thrive. Surgeons should acquire competencies that will enable them to become leaders in the process of AMC transformation.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The lag between the publication of clinical and health-services research and the application of this information is substantial and delays health-care improvement. A wide range of corrective strategies are being used to address this issue., OBJECTIVES: Evolution in the use of significant opinion leaders is described. Hospital quality improvement projects, undertaken by the Healthcare Education and Research Foundation (HERF), are used to illustrate the roles assumed by clinical opinion leaders. Specific theoretical frameworks are reviewed that are fundamental to successful implementation of opinion leader strategies, as well as key research on the use of clinical opinion leaders., RESULTS: Over the past 12 years, HERF has identified the need to address not only the information needs of clinicians and organizations but also the social and organizational factors that interfere with the application of research and guidelines. The complexity of this task cannot be underestimated. However, armed with well-developed guidelines and the opportunity to work within structured guideline implementation programs with well-defined objectives and systematically applied methods, HERF's experience suggest local clinicians and communities can meet this challenge.

N2  - Management education programmes for physicians range from university courses to courses offered by private companies. Some hospitals and regions arrange local management education for physicians in specialist training and certified specialists, but mostly for staff in executive positions. Only 245 places are available on the one-week courses for physicians in specialist training during the whole of year 2000 in Sweden; 637 applications were received for the spring courses only. There are 5,000 physicians in specialist training in Sweden. There is a great need for increased investments in the fields of education in administration, economy, leadership and management for physicians.

N2  - Physician leaders are crucial as never before to ensure the proper integration of good care and cost containment; such integration is both a reasonable expectation of patients and essential for the survival of health care delivery systems. In today's health care environment, a critical mass of physician leaders must be developed in a systematic fashion so that physicians may truly lead the health care enterprise. The authors (1) describe, with examples, the various types and levels of physician leadership training programs currently being offered; (2) explain the costs and benefits of each program type; and (3) offer a program rationale and model (using a program at their medical school), which they analyze using traditional management concepts such as strategic planning, net present value, and make-versus-buy. The authors emphasize that physician leadership training should be local, offer long-term instruction, and be led by physicians. They conclude by stating that the concept of physician leadership will not and should not be taken seriously by non-physician health care executives until the physician community becomes as serious about leadership and management training as it is about clinical training.

Y1  - 2000//
N2  - In the current health care environment of competition and market forces, concern has arisen that the classic principle of serving disadvantaged persons may not be fulfilled due to pressures from managed care. Reach Out, a $12 million national program of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, was developed to recruit leaders from among practicing physicians to organize projects to care for the uninsured and underserved. Physician volunteerism was a key component of all projects. Thirty-nine Reach Out projects were implemented and carried out across the United States, with average funding per project of $300000 distributed over a period of 4 years. Seven model types emerged, the most common of which, the free clinic and the referral network, accounted for two thirds of the total. At the program's conclusion, 199584 patients were enrolled and 11252 physicians recruited. Project execution was more complex than initially supposed, and major progress commonly was not evident until the third or fourth year, but at least two thirds of the projects are likely to continue with local support. With strong physician leadership and a funded administrative core, organized community efforts can develop and sustain an effective program. Programs such as Reach Out cannot solve the national problem of access to health care, but they can make a small but important impact on the number of uninsured and underserved persons without access to health care.

N2  - Health care organizations face significant performance challenges. Achieving desired results requires the highest level of partnership with independent physicians. Tufts Health Plan invited medical directors of its affiliated groups to participate in a leadership development process to improve clinical, service, and business performance. The design included performance review, gap analysis, priority setting, improvement work plans, and defining the optimum practice culture. Medical directors practiced core leadership capabilities, including building a shared context, getting physician buy-in, and managing outliers. The peer learning environment has been sustained in redesigned medical directors' meetings. There has been significant performance improvement in several practices and enhanced relations between the health plan and medical directors.

N2  - Due to rapid changes in the health care industry, physicians are being asked to do much more than just take care of patients. They need an arsenal of additional skills if they want to survive in a shifting health care environment characterized by cost consciousness, competition, and fear of decreasing service quality. Consequently, doctors are searching for opportunities to learn more about the business side of managed care. The University of Tennessee at Chattanooga's School of Business Administration, along with Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Tennessee, the Chattanooga Unit of the University of Tennessee College of Medicine, and Erlanger Medical Center, has developed management education courses for area physicians. This article outlines the implementation of the continuing education programs and provides suggestions for others considering such a program, as well as ideas for future business school and physician education linkages.

N2  - Compliance officers are in a unique position to provide guidance to physicians and will succeed in gaining physician support and buy-in when appropriate steps are taken to integrate physicians into the compliance program. First and foremost, the compliance officer's primary responsibility is to apprise physicians of the seriousness nature of current compliance issues. When physicians are provided with clear information through a variety of media, they will understand that compliance program goals and objectives will resolve compliance-related issues dilemmas. Next, the compliance officer should expect no less than the ideal compliance world. Recruit physician champions who will actively participate in compliance program planning and development. Call upon medical staff members to get involved in implementation stages of compliance action plans and engage physician leaders to educate and train their physician peers on compliance-related issues. Most importantly, minimize individual physician liability by providing adequate education programs to physicians. Help them to master the art of coding and documentation and to mitigate any prospect of fraud and abuse or compliance-related concerns. Last, collaboration is the key--the compliance officer must provide guidance to the physician so that the physician may continue to fulfill the role of leader and healer. In turn, the physician must recognize that his or her actions and those of the hospital and system are inseparable and that they must actively participate in compliance program initiatives.

Y1  - 1999//
N2  - PURPOSE: To determine the effect that a six-hour course on resident teaching and leadership skills had on residents' teaching evaluations., METHOD: The authors analyzed six years of teaching evaluations of second- and third-year internal medicine residents at the University of Washington: three years before and three years after a resident teaching skills course was introduced in 1992. Interns and students rated their resident-teachers using a nine-question standardized clinical teaching assessment form (CTAF). Evaluations at baseline (the three years before the course) were compared with evaluations for the three years after the intervention., RESULTS: The authors analyzed 3,946 evaluations of 235 second-year and 211 third-year residents. Despite already high baseline evaluations, mean ratings of the CTAF showed continuous and statistically significant improvement in each year after the introduction of the course (p < .001). There was no significant difference between evaluations from students and those from interns., CONCLUSION: A six-hour teaching skills course significantly improved residents' teacher ratings. Residents are important teachers of interns and medical students and serve as their primary ward supervisors; therefore, sessions on teaching skills should be part of required curricula for all residency programs.

However, a well-led well-organized approach during the first 10 minutes of care can greatly improve the chances of survival and minimize subsequent morbidity. Early treatment should emphasize proper airway management, adequate intravenous access, and a thoughtful approach to the use of medications.

N2  - This paper discusses post-master's degree internships in three very different organizations; the University of Illinois at Chicago, the National Library of Medicine, and the Library of Congress. It discusses the internships using several questions. Do the programs serve as a recruitment strategy? Do the programs develop key competencies needed by the participant or organization? Do the programs develop leaders and managers? Is acceptance into a program an indicator of future career success? A survey was mailed to 520 persons who had completed internships in one of the three programs. There was a 49.8% response rate. Responses to fifty-four questions were tabulated and analyzed for each program and for the total group. The results confirm the value of internships to the career of participants.

Its purpose is to consider the issues surrounding cross-country doctoral education as identified by doctoral students and to suggest models and strategies that could be used to facilitate cross-country doctoral education. This paper is based on published sources, conversations with doctoral students and personal observations. Nursing, in order to become globally relevant, should develop an independent body committed to cross-country doctoral education. This body should be committed to facilitating and organizing programs that provide opportunities for students and faculty to attain experiences abroad. Several models incorporated under a comprehensive strategy are suggested in this paper.

Y1  - 1998//
N2  - AUPHA faculty members have had the opportunity to provide health care executive training and to work in partnership with academic institutions in Central and Eastern Europe and in the New Independent States of the former Soviet Union. This article presents some observations on health management education that demonstrate the similarity in issues faced by programs in the U.S. and in CEE. The health management educational partnership program was designed to provide technical assistance to emerging health management programs in the CEE. The partnership program has been mutually beneficial for several reasons. The role of physicians in leadership and the management educational needs that result provide one example of an issue that health management educational programs must address. The emergence of the roles of other health professions and growing contribution that they will make has its parallel in the American ascendance of the role of interdisciplinary team in clinical decision making. The partnership and executive training experiences have caused U.S. partners to focus consciously on pedagogical methods. The nature of the issues faced by emerging CEE health management programs suggests that mutual support among programs in the region after the partnership program is necessary in order to provide a forum for debate. The focus of the debate should continue to be on the role of management in health reform, content of curriculum, research focus and pedagogical methods appropriate for health care management undergraduate and graduate programs. The result will be a strengthening of the health management academic discipline in the region. The future of the AUPHA should predicated on the same principles, the roots from which it has grown.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the importance and characteristics of opinion leaders in general practice, particularly in relationship to the use of laboratory tests., DESIGN: Focus group discussions and a mailed survey., SUBJECTS: Five focus groups (n = 29 participants) in four different municipalities and a random sample of 85 general practitioners (GPs) in Norway., RESULTS: While Norwegian GPs recognised colleagues who were influential in determining how they practised, they found it difficult to identify opinion leaders specifically with respect to the use of laboratory tests. Opinion leaders were thought to be less important in influencing the use of laboratory tests than continuing medical education activities and practice guidelines, but more important than industry, patients or personal financial interests. Norwegian GPs recognised and characterised opinion leaders in much the same way as physicians in the USA. Influential colleagues were characterised as being good conveyers of information and willing to take time, as well as being up-to-date and having a high level of clinical expertise. GPs expressed a negative attitude towards 'superspecialists' who give advice without knowing the epidemiology of general practice, people who are arrogant and people who do not show respect towards GPs., CONCLUSIONS: The potential to identify and use opinion leaders to improve the use of laboratory tests by GPs in Norway appears to be limited.

T1  - Job analysis, appraisal and performance assessments of a surgeon--a multifaceted approach.
A1  - Soh, K B
Y1  - 1998//
N2  - The role of a surgeon is a complex one. A variety of skills and abilities in a different array of performance tasks is required before he can be competent in his job. As such, there is no simple rule of thumb that can be used to assess a surgeon's performance. As performance assessment and appraisal become increasingly important both for manpower decisions and personal development, it is important that we recognise the different roles a surgeon plays. Only then are we able to subdivide a surgeon's job demands into small manageable portions for analysis. This paper examines the multi-faceted aspects of a surgeon's job, and how each facet should be individually assessed and appraised.

T1  - Defining competencies and performance indicators for physicians in medical management.
A1  - Lane, D S
A1  - Ross, V
Y1  - 1998//
N2  - The recent and profound changes in the American health care delivery system have created a need for physicians who are trained and willing to assume a high level of responsibility for managing evolving health care organizations. Yet most physicians receive no formal training in medical administration and management because changes in medical school and residency education have lagged behind changes in clinical practice and reimbursement. To avoid haphazard approaches and unnecessary duplication of resources, it is important for physicians involved in managerial medicine to collectively identify competencies in this area needed in the marketplace. The American College of Preventive Medicine (ACPM), with funding from the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), undertook an effort to identify competencies essential for physicians who will fill leadership roles in medical management. Like ACPM's earlier effort to develop core competencies in preventive medicine, this project drew upon the theoretical model of competency-based education. This article describes the strategy we followed in reaching consensus among a diverse group of physician executives and preventive medicine residency program directors, and includes the list of medical management competencies and performance indicators developed. Recurrent issues that can sidetrack competency development projects are also presented as well as suggestions for overcoming them. The competencies can serve as a framework for expanding current core preventive medicine training in management and administration and for developing new training programs to equip physicians with the special expertise they will need to provide management leadership within the changing landscape of health care delivery.

N2  - Health-care organizations have recognized the need to prepare physicians for various leadership and management positions within their own institutions. The demands of a dynamic health-care environment have created increased pressure for institutions to develop a larger cadre of physician leaders and managers among their staff, and this must be done cost-effectively and efficiently. In the past, physicians who wanted more education had to look beyond their practice to fulfill this need. Institutions have begun to create tailor-made programs for their physicians in order to meet the various needs of their staff regarding leadership and management. Herein we describe the educational initiatives undertaken in 1995 and 1996 to provide Mayo physicians with in-house leadership and management programming. A substantial number of institutions are answering the challenge for increased physician expertise in leadership and management through the development of their own in-house programs.

Y1  - 1997//
N2  - Being responsible for medical education places academic health centers at a disadvantage in competing for managed care contracts. Although many suggestions have been made for changing medical education to produce physicians who are better prepared for the managed care environment, few studies have shown how physicians in training can actually contribute to the competitiveness of an academic health center. We present three examples of engaging trainees in projects with a population-based perspective that demonstrate how quality improvement for the academic health center can be operationalized and even led by physicians in training. In addition to gaining experience in a managed care skill that is increasingly important for future employment, physicians in training can simultaneously improve the quality of care delivered through the academic health center.

N2  - Which degree should physician executives pursue to enhance their careers--an MBA, MHA, MPH, MS in Administrative Medicine, JD, or other graduate degree? While options abound and the debate continues over which graduate degree physicians preparing for senior management roles in the health field should select, several variables are analyzed in this article that must be considered. Physicians need to be trained to provide leadership in the new, more market-driven environment--their education must focus more on the integration and coordination of clinical and managerial processes. New managerial competencies will be required by the paradigm shift away from simply delivering effective and efficient health services to one that emphasizes improved access, social equity, and particularly on cost containment and quality of care efforts.

T1  - Developing physician leaders in academic medical centers.
A1  - Bachrach, D J
Y1  - 1997//
N2  - While physicians have historically held positions of leadership in academic medical centers, there is an increasing trend that physicians will not only guide the clinical, curriculum and scientific direction of the institution, but its business direction as well. Physicians are assuming a greater role in business decision making and are found at the negotiating table with leaders from business, insurance and other integrated health care delivery systems. Physicians who lead "strategic business units" within the academic medical center are expected to acquire and demonstrate enhanced business acumen. There is an increasing demand for formal and informal training programs for physicians in academic medical centers in order to better prepare them for their evolving roles and responsibilities. These may include the pursuit of a second degree in business or health care management; intramurally conducted courses in leadership skill development, management, business and finance; or involvement in extramurally prepared and delivered training programs specifically geared toward physicians as conducted at major universities, often in their schools of business or public health. While part one of this series, which appeared in Volume 43, No. 6 of Medical Group Management Journal addressed, "The changing role of physician leaders at academic medical centers," part 2 will examine as a case study the faculty leadership development program at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. These two articles were prepared by the author from his research into, and the presentation of a thesis entitled. "The importance of leadership training and development for physicians in academic medical centers in an increasingly complex health care environment," prepared for the Credentials Committee of the American College of Healthcare Executives in partial fulfillment of the requirements for Fellowship in this College.*

N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Current trends in health care demand expanded competencies for future physicians, including group process skills that traditional medical curricula rarely address. One approach to enhancing group dynamics and teaching teamwork skills is outdoor-based experiential learning. This study examines the effect of an outdoor-based learning intervention on family practice interns' group problem solving, team building, and communication., METHODS: Two of 13 programs in the University of Washington Family Practice Residency Network included structured, outdoor-based experimental leadership training during intern orientation. The other 11 programs served as controls. Within 1 month following orientation, surveys were sent to all University of Washington Network interns. Respondents completed 27 questions designed to assess perceptions of trust, group awareness, group problem solving, group effectiveness, and interpersonal communication within an intern class., RESULTS: The survey response rate was 85%. Study and control groups were not significantly different with respect to age or gender. The study group scored higher on all individual questions and variables, with statistically significant differences on 10 questions and three variables., CONCLUSIONS: Experiential, outdoor-based leadership training may positively influence intern class group formation and development. Experiential training early in residency may reduce intern stress by accelerating intra-class relationships and may represent a foundation on which to build effective group process curricula for residents.

Y1  - 1997//
N2  - Health-care organizations have recognized the need to prepare physicians for various leadership and management positions within their own institutions. In the past, those who desired further education had to search beyond the boundaries of their practice to fulfill this need. The demands of a dynamic and changing health-care environment have created increased pressure on organizations to develop a larger cadre of physician leaders and managers among their staff and to accomplish this outcome in a cost-effective, efficient manner. This article examines the results from a survey of leading medical institutions on the existence of in-house leadership and management educational programming. It also documents the approaches used by the responding organizations and the content of their course work. Numerous institutions are accepting the challenge for increased physician expertise in leadership and management by developing their own in-house programs. Future directions for Mayo initiatives in succession planning will be obtained from this benchmark survey.

N2  - Leadership and management skills are increasingly critical to the success of pathologists in and outside of academic centers. We describe a leadership and management curriculum in a combined anatomic and clinical pathology residency program. The mentor-based approach incorporates leadership and management skills throughout the residency with a dedicated 2-month rotation during the final year of training. This 2-month rotation is led by a senior faculty pathologist mentor and includes active participation in management activities, small group discussions, reading, and a management process project. The topics for the small group discussions, reading list, mentor-based activities, and completed management process projects are described. Outcomes and evaluations are reported for residents who have completed this curriculum in leadership and management.

Y1  - 1997//
N2  - The economic forces that are reshaping the practice of medicine and the funding of medical research will have great impact on clinical education and research in teaching hospitals and their associated medical schools. Changes in the setting of and approach to medical education will need to be made in order to continue to train physicians at the same high level as in the past and to maintain the productivity of our national biomedical research enterprise and its contributions to health. Academic leaders, such as department chiefs who have clinical service responsibilities, are finding it more and more difficult to manage simultaneously the demands of the clinical business, education, and research. In an effort to organize a teaching hospital and a medical school in a manner that would position them to maintain more effectively their common academic mission front and center with the clinical business, Harvard Medical School and the Beth Israel Hospital created a joint venture in 1996. The new nonprofit Institute for Education and Research has education and research as its top (and only) mission. It is designed to provide additional and specific academic leadership and to enable the joint venture to undertake strategic planning for the academic mission. In addition to the challenges it faces from changes in the external environment, the Institute for Education and Research will need to establish a new pattern of interactions internally within the parent institutions. Collaborations with department chairs and faculty are an essential ingredient for its success. It is hoped that this structure will prove to be a useful template for organizing other medical school-hospital collaborations on behalf of the academic mission.

T1  - Educating tomorrow's doctors: the thing that really matters is that we care.
A1  - Wallace, A G
Y1  - 1997//
N2  - The unique purpose of medical schools is to select and educate competent, caring physicians capable of meeting society's expectations for health care. The author discusses this purpose first in the context of liberal education, which provides a broad perspective essential in the education of doctors and other professionals. Such an education can be achieved partly by how medical students are selected and by effectively uniting it with professional learning. The most important goal of liberal education is to promote intellectual wholeness as a lifelong pursuit of physicians. Second, the author reviews medical curricula, which have been slowly evolving away from a focus on providing instruction and toward one of producing learning. This new approach is a more rational one, and can be seen in some schools' reductions of lectures and increases in team teaching and problem-based learning, and earlier exposure of students to patients, especially in ambulatory care settings. An important role of medical educators is to provide enough free time for students to learn, and to pay attention to the "informal curriculum," where the unwritten ethical codes of medicine are revealed. The author then turns to issues of professionalism, especially that elusive part that goes beyond expertise. He emphasizes that the training of tomorrow's doctors is ultimately a public goal, and that medical schools must help restore public trust in doctors by selecting and nurturing professionals who see medicine in a broad social context. He reiterates that a liberally educated doctor is most likely to have such an outlook, and concludes by urging medical educators to remember that there is no substitute for a doctor's competence, caring, and professionalism expressed in the context of a liberally educated mind. And that the most important thing that educators can do as they bend to their task is to care.

Y1  - 1997//
N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The complex and unique challenge of academic medicine requires that faculty possess both organizational and leadership skills. This article presents a framework of leadership and organizational skills in family medicine., METHODS: We conducted a focused review of the literature, of presentations at national primary care meetings, and of the curricula of several national faculty development fellowship programs to identify the current emphases, strategies, and outcomes regarding organizational and leadership development activities for academic physicians., RESULTS: We identified three types of organizational and leadership development strategies and programs, including isolated faculty development workshops at national meetings, longitudinal faculty development fellowship programs, and organizational change efforts within an academic department or residency training program. Indicators that these efforts are successful have primarily been reported in the context of career satisfaction, retention in academic medicine, and attainment of administrative roles or higher academic rank among faculty who have participated., CONCLUSIONS: Organizational and leadership development is occurring in the context of both individual and organizational initiatives. We propose a cycle-of-learning framework that provides one model for development of these essential skills.

T1  - Developing physician leaders in academic medical centers. Part 1: Their changing role.
A1  - Bachrach, D J
Y1  - 1996//
N2  - While physicians have historically held positions of leadership in academic medical centers, there is an increasing trend that physicians will not only guide the clinical, curriculum and scientific direction of the institution, but its business direction as well. Physicians are assuming a greater role in business decision making and are found at the negotiating table with leaders from business, insurance and other integrated health care delivery systems. Physicians who lead "strategic business units" within the academic medical center are expected to acquire and demonstrate enhanced business acumen. There is an increasing demand for formal and informal training programs for physicians in academic medical centers in order to better prepare them for their evolving roles and responsibilities. These may include the pursuit of a second degree in business or health care management, intramurally conducted courses in leadership skill development; management, business and finance; or involvement in extramurally prepared and delivered training programs specifically geared toward physicians as conducted at major universities, often in their schools of business or public health. This article article was prepared by the author from research into and presentation of a thesis entitled. "The Importance of Leadership Training And Development For Physicians In Academic Medical Centers In An Increasingly Complex Healthcare Environment, " prepared for the Credentials Committee of the American College of Healthcare Executives in partial fulfillment of the requirements for Fellowship in the College (ACHE). Part 2 will appear in the next issue of the Journal.

N2  - Available experience indicates that physician support is crucial if clinical pathways are to support quality of care while reducing lengths of stay and resource use. Enlisting such support requires understanding of physician perspectives concerning the quality and delivery of health care. It also requires the development of data systems as a means of communication with physicians.

Y1  - 1995//
N2  - Dramatic changes are occurring at a rapid pace throughout the United States in virtually all aspects of health care delivery. Physicians, hospitals, consumer groups, and others are thus facing new and greater uncertainties and are forced to adapt to a continually shifting environment. Fundamental change of this magnitude has and will continue to result in the formation of new alliances and organizations within which physicians and others will be forced to function. To participate effectively in these processes of change and to maintain influence within these new organizations, physicians will need leadership and management skills. To address the challenges facing current physician leaders and the need to develop more effective leaders, Sharp HealthCare developed its Physician Executive Leadership Program. This article describes the program and summarizes some of the lessons learned regarding the training of physician executives and leaders in today's changing health care environment.

N2  - With the proliferation of prospective payment, managed care and the concomitant shift in risk from payer to provider, hospitals are investing in utilization management programs to reduce cost per case while maintaining or improving clinical quality. This article discusses a major component of the utilization management program at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation: the use of physician champions. Overall, the length of stay reduction initiative resulted in a shorter average length of stay by 1.8 days (22 percent).

N2  - On Match Day in 1991, Broadlawns Medical Center in Des Moines, Iowa, learned that no residents had matched for the family practice residency program. In the 1992 match, the medical center filled all its residency positions, and repeated the success in the 1993 and 1994 matches. Broadlawns affected this impressively rapid turnaround through a strong commitment to bring its program to a level competitive with leading family practice residency programs, substantive changes to the structure and curriculum of the program, and significant expenditures of time, resources and personal energy. The Broadlawns' case illustrates the need for family practice residency programs to position themselves as strong competitors in the residency market.

N2  - The concept of leadership may be the most widely studied and least understood topic in the domain of social services. Leadership has been described as a major force in the profession's transition to pharmaceutical care and effective program development. Pharmacy practice residency programs are a major means of developing and sustaining leadership for the growth of the profession. Three concepts that are explored include: (1) some insight into noncognitive elements of residency training that are critical to the development of professional practice, (2) analysis of leadership perceived to be critical for pharmacists, and (3) a definition of how residency training can develop professional leaders to meet the challenges for pharmacy.

Y1  - 1995//
N2  - BACKGROUND: The Maine Medical Assessment Foundation (MMAF) has successfully involved hundreds of Maine physicians in study groups to analyze data on small-area variation and assess physician decision-making patterns. In 1991 the MMAF model was replicated across a tri-state area (Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont) in an effort called the Outcomes Dissemination Project, which is funded by a five-year grant from the U.S. Agency for Health Care Policy and Research., THE OUTCOMES DISSEMINATION PROJECT: Five specialty study groups, each meeting three times a year, examine local and national utilization data, examine guidelines and research findings, participate in outcomes studies and patient education, and disseminate their findings through specialty society presentations and other feedback efforts. The MMAF study group process is based on the beliefs that medicine is a subculture with a complex set of professional values, beliefs, socialization processes, and norms, and that quality improvement efforts work best when they are nonpunitive and educational., ISSUES IN OBTAINING PHYSICIAN INVOLVEMENT: (1) Physicians are willing to change their practices if they are brought into a culturally appropriate improvement program. (2) Related specialties (for example, internists and family practitioners) can often work together effectively on issues of common interest. (3) Involving respected clinical leaders has helped establish the legitimacy of MMAF methods among physicians. (4) Area- and physician-specific data are not made public, so as to build a sense of confidentiality among participants., CONCLUSIONS: The project continues to function as a powerful education process and serves as a model for replication elsewhere.

N1  - Comment in: Acad Med. 1997 Jan;72(1):1-2; PMID: 9008556
N2  - To assist new senior residents with their transition from internship to ward-team leadership, a practical teaching course has been implemented at the University of Washington that integrates the residents' roles as teachers and team supervisors. Residents develop leadership and problem-solving skills by discussing sample cases and videotaped vignettes of typical situations they will encounter. Teaching skills are practiced through small-group role-plays, which illustrate brief teaching opportunities in patient care. Residents learn managerial techniques, including how to clarify goals and expectations with team members, to conduct work rounds efficiently, to provide ongoing feedback as well as formal evaluation, and to develop criteria for grading. Emphasis is also given to residents' communication with attending physicians and ways residents can increase the attending physicians' effectiveness on the teams. Residents learn to teach and direct medical students, to refine case presentations, and to include students as valued team members. Because residency stresses can lead to coping problems, residents are taught to recognize burn-out, depression, and signs of substance abuse. Residents have been overwhelmingly positive in their evaluations of and responses to the teaching course. By working to develop problem-solving and teaching skills prior to undertaking their new responsibilities, residents are better prepared to be ward-team leaders. Factors in developing such a teaching course for residents are reviewed.

Y1  - 1994//
N2  - Changes occurring in health care demand that physicians expand their professional knowledge and skills beyond the medical and behavioral sciences. Subjects absent from traditional medical education curricula, such as the economics and politics of health care, practice management, and leadership of professional organizations, will become important competencies, particularly for physicians who serve in management roles. Because physicians occupy a central role in planning and allocating medical care services and other health care resources, they must be better prepared to work with other health care professionals to create a new civilization, even if this means leaving the cloistered domain of "physician land" to serve as interface professionals between the delivery of medical services and the management of health care. Our research findings and conclusions strongly suggest that economic, management, and leadership competencies need to be incorporated into the professional development of physicians, especially in postgraduate and continuing education curricula.

N2  - Today's health care delivery system and the educational process that produces health care providers are not the systems of 15 years ago, nor are they the systems that we will see in 10 or 15 years. With 40 years' experience as a physician, innovator, and developer of managed health care systems, Dr. Robert Gumbiner discusses the problems with the existing educational system for physicians. He outlines reasons behind suggested changes that would better equip health care providers in the future and he makes recommendations for improving the quality of medical school curriculum and the physicians produced by the system. Gumbiner heads FHP, a managed care organization that serves 2.5 million people, employs 11,000, and contracts with more than 3,000 individual practice physicians and 200 hospitals.

N2  - To summarize this rather wide-ranging study, let us review the high points. The future practice of thoracic surgery will be increasingly affected by governmental factors and will have even greater technological dimensions. To do this work, we must continue to attract high-caliber individuals, and this is best accomplished by the early and continuing involvement in the educational process of strong role models from our field. These future surgeons must be motivated to do good work and should have high ethical standards as well as maturity and high intelligence. Experienced, involved faculty leading the residents through a broad program that offers graduated assumption of clinical and leadership responsibilities will facilitate the development of mature clinical judgment. Residents must be taught the clinical skills necessary to do all thoracic operations, leaving subspecialization to postresidency fellowships. The educational program should be humane in its demands and collegial in its application. It should incorporate experiences beyond the operating room, including the opportunity to read, think, and interact with local mentors and colleagues from around the country. The requirements of certification should not be so rigid as to preclude the development of different pathways to the same end. Likewise, although the accreditation process must protect the resident from exploitation, it must not be so restrictive that it does not allow for educational innovation and justifiable differences among programs. These are the thoughtful opinions of our colleagues. They deserve serious consideration.

Y1  - 1993//
N2  - A large majority of physical medicine and rehabilitation residencies have chief resident positions, but little has been written about the expectations of the program directors and the training of the chief resident to fulfill those expectations. A 20-item questionnaire was mailed to 73 program directors in physical medicine and rehabilitation in May 1992. The participants were asked about selection methods, their perception of the duties of the chief resident(s), their concerns about the chief resident(s) position, the training and the evaluation of the chief resident(s). An 85% (62/73) response rate was achieved. There was a chief resident position(s) in 98% of the programs responding. Chief resident selection was made mostly by appointment of the chairman and/or program director and/or the vote of the faculty. The program directors perceived the most important duties of the chief resident to be: act as a liaison between faculty and the residents, act as a role model, do scheduling, build teamwork and give constructive feedback. The most important skills were considered to be leadership and stress management. Causes of concern were time pressure, abuse of power, stress and work overload. Opportunities to develop leadership and administrative/management skills were considered the most exciting aspects of the position. It was surprising, however, that only 15 of 61 (25%) provided some formal training. Only 28 of 61 (46%) had a position description.

Y1  - 1993//
N2  - Nursing in the next century will reflect changes in the health care system, and although the profession has made great strides in preparing nurse researchers, the current system has a serious gap that must be addressed; that of preparing clinical leaders. The article describes the need for a practice-focused doctoral curriculum that will produce a new type of senior clinician or expert practitioner to fill this gap. The envisioned graduates will be skilled in clinical decision making and information processing and will effect changes at both the micro- and macro-levels of the system. There is a clear future need to expand the number of primary care providers. The faculty required for their education must be doctorally prepared nurses who are themselves clinically proficient. The research and practice doctorates should be differentiated by faculty, the program of studies, resources, and placement/expectation of graduates. The article includes a model curriculum plan.

N2  - In September 1990, 40 doctors started a two year management training programme consisting of six one week courses organised by the Norwegian Medical Association. The programme was evaluated, and this article presents the results of two of the methods, used for evaluation: the first an interview with 12 participants, and the second a questionnaire answered by participants, colleagues at the same department and colleagues at other hospitals (a control group) before and after the course. Compared with colleagues from the same department and from the control group the participants had changed their attitude towards important questions of management. They had become more concerned about the importance of motivating the staff, that the department should give priority to the hospital's objectives in preference to own interests, and that the ultimate responsibility for the department should reside in one person and this person should be a doctor with a relevant specialty. The results of the questionnaire survey are confirmed by the results of the interviews. In addition the results of the interviews suggest that, during the management training programme, the participants had changed from an individual-oriented to a more group-oriented style of management.

T1  - Compensating and providing incentives for academic physicians: balancing earning, clinical, research, teaching, and administrative responsibilities.
A1  - Ceriani, P J
Y1  - 1992//
N2  - Providing a comprehensive compensation and incentive plan for a group of faculty members in a department with multiple goals provides a challenge that few administrators may take. Many academic departments have given up on implementing a comprehensive compensation and incentive plan since department goals generate competing uses of a faculty member's time. Whatever the plan design your department adopts, you can be sure that it will generate controversy. The JPN department has attempted to reward and encourage faculty members to pursue scholarly activities balanced with clinical activities. As a result, this strategy has only considered physicians who can generate both clinical income and research funding. Thus far, the JPN department faculty have embraced the plan. Long-term effects are not known as this is the first year of the plan. The measure of a successful total compensation program is one that develops a sense of entrepreneurship among its members to develop new clinical programs, to pursue new research collaborations, and to devise innovative methods of training. The program described in this article is not intended to serve as the ideal model for all departments, even in academic institutions, but rather to provide a strategy that may have applicability to many other departments where the goals induce inherent conflict for faculty members attempting to decide where to place their time commitments. In addition, this strategy does not work well on an individual basis for young, beginning faculty members but does work well in the collective--to promote the goals of the department. Be prepared, however, to modify your plan after a trial period of perhaps two years. You must allow time to monitor the effects of your compensation plan and its impact on the goals and direction of the department.

Under what is known as the Management Residency Programme, young graduates are recruited to undertake a rigorous two year programme which blends the academic specialisation necessary for health managers, with the techniques of action learning available through exposure to a range of management situations in various field placements. The proponents of action research are seriously challenging the traditional approach to management education and the Management Residency Programme provides a unique opportunity to maximise the benefits of each philosophy.

T1  - Preparing stewards for tomorrow. A healthcare system's intern program provides mentors for potential trustees.
A1  - Carey, M J
Y1  - 1991//
N2  - Mentors can provide support essential to a person's advancement and growth in a new business or position. Because of the complex and rapidly changing nature of healthcare, mentors can be particularly valuable to persons interested in becoming healthcare facility trustees. Since 1987, the Sisters of Mercy Health System (SMHS), St. Louis, has implemented a comprehensive intern program for potential trustees. Each intern is assigned to a board and a board member mentor at an SMHS facility. The program lasts for two years and includes a didactic component, independent study, clinical experience, regularly scheduled meetings, and issuance of a certificate on completion. Thus far, the interns have been sisters from education, healthcare, social service, or other ministries. They must show abilities crucial for successful trustees (such as listening skills), an appreciation of and strong support for the ministry, and a willingness to commit the time and energy to the program. Mentors chosen for the program also must devote time to orientation and meetings and must assist interns in integrating mission and values into board activities. In addition, mentors help interns identify the focus of present structures and resources and their appropriateness and discuss the trustee's role and responsibilities and dynamics for quality decision making.

N2  - In June 1989 the first Family Practice Chief Resident Leadership Conference was presented to 27 Texas second-year residents who had been selected to serve as chief residents during their third year. The objectives of the conference were to assist these emerging leaders to develop better stress management and leadership skills and to strengthen their ties with the Texas Academy of Family Physicians. The conference featured two major workshops on stress management and leadership skills, and included plenary speeches and large and small group discussions. This article reports the outcomes of the conference as measured by the evaluation instrument completed by participants. Analysis of the results indicated that the conference had a positive effect on the residents.

N2  - Most future medical leaders receive little or no formal exposure to management and leadership training activities. Industry invests considerable resources in such training for middle and senior level managers. With the increasing complexity of health care delivery systems and the increased involvement of diverse teams of individuals in the care of patients, it was believed that a training activity designed to enhance participant human interaction skills and teach about group behavior and team management might be valuable to pediatric chief residents. This article describes a 3-day workshop designed to develop such leadership skills. It has been conducted for 3 years with 117 participants. Results of end-of-course and 6-month follow-up evaluations show that participants enjoyed the training experience and believed it was valuable in helping them fulfill their leadership role as chief resident.

N2  - A randomized controlled trial with 76 physicians in 16 community hospitals evaluated audit and feedback and local opinion leader education as methods of encouraging compliance with a guideline for the management of women with a previous cesarean section. The guideline recommended clinical actions to increase trial of labor and vaginal birth rates. Charts for all 3552 cases in the study groups were audited. After 24 months the trial of labor and vaginal birth rates in the audit and feedback group were no different from those in the control group, but rates were 46% and 85% higher, respectively, among physicians educated by an opinion leader. Duration of hospital stay was lower in the opinion leader education group than in the other two groups. The overall cesarean section rate was reduced only in the opinion leader education group. There were no adverse clinical outcomes attributable to the interventions. The use of opinion leaders improved the quality of care.

N2  - The investigators conducted a survey of Balint group activities among family practice residencies in the United States. The survey was designed to discover how many programs have Balint groups as well as the groups' characteristics, leadership, and structure. Of the 381 family practice residencies surveyed, 93% responded. Of those, 66 offered Balint seminars to 115 different groups. Most groups met at weekly intervals for two to three years. Most groups were led by family physicians (32%), psychologists (25%), or social workers (19%). Most leaders followed the format of a spontaneous case presentation from memory. Support for residents and resolution of professional role conflict were rated as the two major objectives of training. The leaders rated an understanding of feelings generated when with patients and an enhanced sense of professional self-worth as the most attainable attitudinal changes.

T1  - The beginning of baccalaureate nursing education at the University of Kansas: a midwestern experience.
A1  - Veith, S
Y1  - 1990//
N2  - An issue in the historiography of nursing is whether nurses desired baccalaureate education for their occupation, and were unable to accomplish this, or whether they preferred diploma schools. Examination of resource materials at a midwestern university revealed that nurses were neither victims nor heroines of a male-dominated system. Although the evidence supports the oppressor/victim model of women in the professions, it also shows that nurses were instrumental in challenging the university to respond to the need for upgraded nursing education. Particularly striking in the resource material was the effect student nurses had on the development of the occupation at this institution.

N2  - PURPOSE: To identify self-perceived problems in managing science information needs of U.S. primary practitioners and their opinion leaders., SAMPLE: A two-stage random sample of the American Medical Association's "Masterlist of Physicians" to identify 625 office-based physicians, including general practice, family practice, internal medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, and pediatrics, and 100 physician opinion leaders., DATA COLLECTION: A formal telephone survey was completed for 79% of practitioners and 90% of opinion leaders sampled, using a pretested instrument applied by trained telephone surveyors., RESULTS OF DATA ANALYSIS: Both practitioners and opinion leaders claimed that published reviews were the most useful means of identifying their information needs. When asked about use of six recent clinical advances, that is, "markers," for example, hemoglobin-A1C for diabetic control, as many as one fifth to one half were not using or were not aware of such an advance. Less than 1 in 3 practitioners personally searched the literature when information was needed; 2 in 3 claimed literature volume was unmanageable; 9 of 10 practitioners and opinion leaders assessed the scientific value of literature obtained, primarily from their own experience, with less than 1 in 10 contacting research methods specialists. Respondents suggested various innovations to better manage their science information needs in the future., CONCLUSIONS: Primary practitioners require substantial help in meeting current science information needs. Increase in such resources as "validated reviews" or "expert networks" might help meet these needs.

A1  - Davidhizar, R E
Y1  - 1988//
N2  - Mentoring has historically been common among men. Recently, however, mentoring has emerged as a popular concept in nursing and more and more references in the nursing literature describe the importance of a mentor to the nurse. Mentoring is also an important concept in doctoral education in nursing. This paper discusses both the development of mentoring relationship which can vitally contribute to the development of the nurse leader are discussed.

A1  - Jacobs, M O
A1  - Mott, P D
Y1  - 1987//
N2  - Health maintenance organizations (HMOs) are growing rapidly and employing increasing numbers of physicians. It is important for medical educators to know what such organizations consider important physician traits and training experiences for their recruitment and retention of physicians. A survey of all HMOs in the United States in 1986, to which 44 percent responded, indicated that they want the curriculum of medical school and/or residency programs to have increased emphasis on cost-effective use of diagnostic and treatment services, utilization review and quality assurance, the role of primary care "gate-keeper," and financing of health services. The most important criteria in selection of physicians by HMOs were the physician's board eligibility, motivation, bedside manner, adaptability to a changing environment, the ability to work in a team, training being done in a U.S. medical school, and ability to relate to nonphysician staff members and the reputation of the physician's residency program.

The findings documented the active participation of women in leadership roles as psychiatric residents in education, administration, and clinical care. Men and women reported remarkably similar job descriptions, opportunities, and difficulties. Women were less likely than men to participate in research activities during the chief residency or to accept full-time faculty positions after training.

Y1  - 1981//
N2  - Family medicine leadership is faced with the challenge of maintaining the progressive development of a new academic discipline. Academic administration has presented a dilemma to all fields, and there has been very limited training to assist administrators in academe. A survey of department chairmen and residency directors in family medicine determined that a high percentage of leaders have moved into their positions directly from practice or from faculty responsibilities. Predominant needs were in the areas of finance, external relationships, time management, and conflict intervention. There are several implications from this study which should be considered in the selection, training, and evaluation of academic family medicine administrators.
