AB - BACKGROUND: We based the Patient Safety Leadership Academy (PSLA) on the premise that improving management skills could improve patient safety and employee satisfaction. STUDY DESIGN: Fellows completed baseline surveys on leadership skills knowledge, patient safety knowledge, and program goals. They completed the same surveys 7 months later at the final PSLA session. The fellows also completed a survey assessing how PSLA improved expertise and comparing PSLA to other patient safety learning opportunities. Matched pairs t tests were used to compare baseline and postprogram results. RESULTS: Baseline scores indicated appropriateness of focusing on leadership, with average leadership knowledge (2.48) significantly lower than patient safety knowledge (3.22). For patient safety, postprogram results were significant for 8 of 10 questions. All results were significant for leadership. Fellows also rated skills covered by the curriculum on a scale of 1 to 10. For all areas, the median score for knowledge gained was 7. When compared with other patient safety learning experiences, participants rated PSLA as 4 or 5, where 1 indicated the other experience much more valuable and 5 much more valuable. CONCLUSIONS: PSLA demonstrates that leadership skills are perceived as important by physicians and managers in surgical areas. This study demonstrated that a leadership skills approach to patient safety training could improve knowledge in specific leadership areas and general patient safety. ©2007Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

AB - BACKGROUND: In 2005 a competency based curriculum was introduced in the Dutch postgraduate medical training programs. While the manager's role is one of the seven key competencies, there is still no formal management course in most postgraduate curricula. Based on a needs assessment we conducted, several themes were identified as important for a possible management training program. We present the results of the pilot training we performed to investigate two of these themes., METHODS: The topics "knowledge of the healthcare system" and "time management" were developed from the list of suggested management training themes. Fourteen residents participated in the training and twenty-four residents served as control. The training consisted of two sessions of four hours with a homework assignment in between. 50 True/false-questions were given as pre- and post-test to both the test and control groups to assess the level of acquired knowledge among the test group as well as the impact of the intervention. We also performed a qualitative evaluation using evaluation forms and in-depth interviews., RESULTS: All fourteen residents completed the training. Six residents in the control group were lost to follow up. The pre- and post-test showed improvement among the participating residents in comparison to the residents from the control group, but this improvement was not significant. The qualitative assessment showed that all residents evaluated the training positively and experienced it as a useful addition to their training in becoming a medical specialist., CONCLUSION: Our training was evaluated positively and considered to be valuable. This study supports the need for mandatory medical management training as part of the postgraduate medical curriculum. Our training could be an example of how to teach two important themes in the broad area of medical management education.

AB - Background. Leadership courses and multi-source feedback are widely used developmental tools for leaders in health care. On this background we aimed to study the additional effect of a leadership course following a multi-source feedback procedure compared to multi-source feedback alone especially regarding development of leadership skills over time. Methods. Study participants were consultants responsible for postgraduate medical education at clinical departments. Study design: pre-post measures with an intervention and control group. The intervention was participation in a seven-day leadership course. Scores of multi-source feedback from the consultants responsible for education and respondents (heads of department, consultants and doctors in specialist training) were collected before and one year after the intervention and analysed using Mann-Whitney's U-test and Multivariate analysis of variances. Results. There were no differences in multi-source feedback scores at one year follow up compared to baseline measurements, either in the intervention or in the control group (p = 0.149). Conclusion. The study indicates that a leadership course following a MSF procedure compared to MSF alone does not improve leadership skills of consultants responsible for education in clinical departments. Developing leadership skills takes time and the time frame of one year might have been too short to show improvement in leadership skills of consultants responsible for education. Further studies are needed to investigate if other combination of initiatives to develop leadership might have more impact in the clinical setting. © 2009 Malling et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB - To achieve care integration required for efficient high-quality care, physicians are increasingly organized into large multispecialty groups. The success of these groups depends in large part on the ability of leadership to successfully navigate the shifting reimbursement, regulatory, and quality and safety terrain, while simultaneously providing their physicians with a rewarding practice environment. The knowledge and management tools required for such leadership are not taught in medical school or residency and are rarely acquired as a product of day-to-day physician activities. In an effort to meet these challenges, the Massachusetts General Physicians Organization created a leadership development program. This article details the development, implementation, and experience of the program. ?? 2010 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB - OBJECTIVE: Although leadership is a core component of the work life of physicians, most physicians are ill-prepared to assume leadership roles upon completion of residency training. The authors sought to determine if medical residents could learn the components of emotional intelligence and thereby facilitate improved leadership styles.\n\nMETHODS: The authors created an educational workshop that included readings (provided to attendees in preparation for the workshop), a formalized presentation on emotional intelligence, and role-playing of scenarios (with debriefing and discussion) involving leadership opportunities.\n\nRESULTS: The majority of participants reported that they left the workshop more informed about leadership and with more skills that could enhance their roles as leaders.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: While enhancing knowledge and skills, which were demonstrated after attendance at a seminar, additional measures of effective leadership are still needed.

AB - BACKGROUND: The Health and Social Care Act 2012 represents the most complex National Health Service reforms in history. High-quality clinical leadership is important for successful implementation of health service reform. However, little is known about the effectiveness of current leadership training. PURPOSE: This study describes the use of a behavioral simulation to improve the knowledge and leadership of a cohort of medical doctors expected to take leadership roles in the National Health Service. METHODOLOGY: A day-long behavioral simulation (The Crucible) was developed and run based on a fictitious but realistic health economy. Participants completed pre- and postsimulation questionnaires generating qualitative and quantitative data. Leadership skills, knowledge, and behavior change processes described by the "theory of planned behavior" were self-assessed pre- and postsimulation. RESULTS: Sixty-nine medical doctors attended. Participants deemed the simulation immersive and relevant. Significant improvements were shown in perceived knowledge, capability, attitudes, subjective norms, intentions, and leadership competency following the program. Nearly one third of participants reported that they had implemented knowledge and skills from the simulation into practice within 4 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: This study systematically demonstrates the effectiveness of behavioral simulation for clinical management training and understanding of health policy reform. Potential future uses and strategies for analysis are discussed. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: High-quality care requires understanding of health systems and strong leadership. Policymakers should consider the use of behavioral simulation to improve understanding of health service reform and development of leadership skills in clinicians, who readily adopt skills from simulation into everyday practice.

AB - PURPOSE: The purpose of this paper is to present a case study which details the successful development, design and deployment of a leadership course for academic medical department chairs. The course provides a needed local and contextual alternative to the lengthy and often theoretical MBA/MHA. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: Faculty developers used a multi-tiered methodology for developing the physician leadership course. The methodology consisted of literature findings, needs assessment, stakeholder input and structured interviews with administrative leaders. FINDINGS: The research, stakeholder input and interviews revealed an increasing number of physician leaders with a general lack of fundamental administrative leadership skills. These shortfalls are largely because of underexposure to core management competencies during medical school and limited contextual knowledge outside their organization. There is an urgent need for leadership development opportunities aimed at current and future academic medical department chairs. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS: This research is limited by the assumptions that the curriculum meets the ever-changing needs of health-care leaders, the course's focus on academic medical department chairs within the Texas Medical Center and the lack of long range follow-up data to substantiate the effectiveness of the curriculum content and course structure. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: The Academic Medical Department Leadership course offers valuable management skills training which complements standard medical training. Much of the course structure and content is adaptable to physician administrative and leadership positions in all settings. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: Although the Academic Medical Department Leadership course is a response to a local concern, the study offers a generalizable approach to addressing the demand for skilled physician leaders.

AB - Objective: This pilot project, which was jointly conducted by a hospital and a university, describes the development of the Master's Degree Programme in Leadership in Medicine, a course designed to supplement medical specialty training. The aim of the pilot project is to demonstrate how hospital-based projects on personnel and organisational development undertaken under academic supervision can be used to increase leadership responsibility among doctors whose duties include providing initial and follow-on training and to professionalise medical specialty training as a leadership task. This need arose from the nationwide requirements and an internal audit regarding follow-on training. The version of the degree programme described below aims to further the personnel development of the participants in the field of didactics. Method: Each of the nine modules is made up of two classroom-based phases and one distance learning phase. The distance learning phase involves undertaking hospital-based projects on personnel and organisational development under academic supervision. The pilot phase participants were hospital doctors who, as part of their duties, hold leadership responsibility or are involved in the follow-on training of doctors. Results: The 17 participants successfully implemented more than 30 hospital-based projects during the distance learning phases of the nine modules. These projects included the development of medical specialty curricula, relevant didactic methods and evaluation design and were subsequently presented and subjected to reflection in interdisciplinary groups. The project presentation together with the project report were regarded as proof of competency. Conclusion: In addition to enhancing participant competency, the degree model described, which interlinks theory and practice, promotes organisational development through the implementation of projects undertaken under academic supervision. This has a double impact on the quality of medical follow-on training at the hospital where the participant is based, for not only is the individual's didactic competency enhanced, but so is the "learning organisation" as a whole as a result of continuous project orientation.

AB - Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to refect upon a workplace-based, interdisciplinary clinical leadership training programme (CLP) to increase willingness to take on leadership roles in a large regional health-care centre in Victoria, Australia. Strengthening the leadership capacity of clinical staff is an advocated strategy for improving patient safety and quality ofcare.An interdisciplinary approach to leadership is increasingly emphasised in the literature; however, externally sourced training programmes are expensive and tend to target a single discipline. Design/methodology/approach – Appraisal of the frst two years of CLP using multiple sourced feedback. A structured survey questionnaire with closed-ended questions graded using a fve-point Likert scale was completed by participants of the 2012 programme. Participants from the 2011 programme were followed up for 18 months after completion of the programme to identify the uptake of new leadership roles. A refective session was also completed by a senior executive staff that supported the implementation of the programme. Findings – Workplace-based CLP is a low-cost and multidisciplinary alternative to externally sourced leadership courses. The CLP signifcantly increased willingness to take on leadership roles. Most participants (93 per cent) reported that they were more willing to take on a leadership role within their team. Fewer were willing to lead at the level of department (79 per cent) or organisation (64 per cent). Fiveof the11participants from the 2011 programme had taken on a new leadership role 18 months later. Senior executive feedback was positive especially around the engagement and building of staff confdence. They considered that the CLP had suffcient merit to support continuation for at least another two years. Originality/value – Integrating health-care professionals into formal and informal leadership roles is essential to implement organisational change as part of the drive to improve the safety and quality of care for patients and service users. This is the frst interdisciplinary, workplace-based leadership programme to be described in the literature, and demonstrates that it is possible to deliver low-cost, sustainable and productive training that increases the willingness to take on leadership roles.

AB - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to review eight major evaluations of leadership and management development programmes in parts of the UK National Health Service and also to identify learning from these as a basis for an evaluation framework which focuses on impact within healthcare organisations. Design/methodology/approach: Eight evaluations conducted over a 13-year period are reviewed in terms of the staff groups covered, numbers involved, duration, programme elements, evaluation approach adopted and key learning points. General conclusions are derived from this review. Findings: Although each evaluation relates to a unique context or setting, there are clear common messages running across all those studied which are of wider interest and concern. Practical implications: The framework developed from the review may be useful to those commissioning, designing, delivering and evaluating leadership programmes. Originality/value: The paper seeks to identify common learning across programmes involving some 1,653 people, ranging in duration from seven to 18 months and covering first-line clinical management to executive director positions. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB - Background: Because of modern challenges in quality, safety, patient centeredness, and cost, health care is evolving to adopt leadership practices of highly effective organizations. Traditional physician training includes little focus on developing leadership skills, which necessitates further training to achieve the potential of collaborative management. Purpose: The aim of this study was to design a leadership program using established models for continuing medical education and to assess its impact on participants' knowledge, skills, attitudes, and performance. Methodology/Approach: The program, delivered over 9 months, addressed leadership topics and was designed around a framework based on how physicians learn new clinical skills, using multiple experiential learning methods, including a leadership active learning project. The program was evaluated using Kirkpatrick's assessment levels: reaction to the program, learning, changes in behavior, and results. Four cohorts are evaluated (2008-2011). Results: Reaction: The program was rated highly by participants (mean = 4.5 of 5). Learning: Significant improvements were reported in knowledge, skills, and attitudes surrounding leadership competencies. Behavior: The majority (80%-100%) of participants reported plans to use learned leadership skills in their work. Improved team leadership behaviors were shown by increased engagement of project team members. Results: All participants completed a team project during the program, adding value to the institution. Conclusion: Results support the hypothesis that learning approaches known to be effective for other types of physician education are successful when applied to leadership development training. Across all four assessment levels, the program was effective in improving leadership competencies essential to meeting the complex needs of the changing health care system. Practice implications: Developing in-house programs that fit the framework established for continuing medical education can increase physician leadership competencies and add value to health care institutions. Active learning projects provide opportunities to practice leadership skills addressing real word problems.

AB - Background The Scottish Clinical Leadership Fellowship (SCLF) is a 1-year programme to help medical and dental specialty trainees develop as future clinical leaders for the National Health Service (NHS) in Scotland. This preliminary programme evaluation combines qualitative and quantitative data from the 2016/2017 SCLF cohort. It will lay the foundation for a future more detailed evaluation study. Methods Data from written reflections were combined with accounts from a residential day and results of an anonymous survey. The survey considered the various personal development activities of the SCLF and how fellows' perspectives had changed over the year. Results were thematically analysed. Results The 2016/2017 cohort comprised 12 doctors. Fellows were left with highly positive views of the SCLF and their ability to influence their NHS organisation on return to practice. Personal reflections were assessed in six different themes, while the lessons fellows identified felt would shape their future clinical careers centred around personal behaviour, how fellows interacted with teams and their organisation, and improved leadership skills in general. Conclusion This preliminary programme evaluation is the first such exercise completed on the SCLF. The highly positive findings have helped shape the programme for the subsequent cohort and will inform a future more detailed evaluation study.

AB - Background Leadership in the National Health Service (NHS) embraces two distinct groups: managers and clinicians, often arriving with differing backgrounds, skill sets and outlook. 'Bridging the gap' between the two, with a relational paired learning (PL) approach, has been run in NHS Lothian for 4 years (three cohorts) to positively impact the organisation and its leadership. Methods In the initial pilot six doctors and six general managers were paired together. Subsequently cohorts expanded with doctors paired with other senior managers, including the Director of eHealth, a non-executive member of the NHS Lothian Board and shadowing of the Chairman of NHS Lothian. All cohorts used PL 'Contracts' for their work together and then engaged in conversation, shadowing and reflection. Preprogramme and postprogramme questionnaires and postprogramme interviews explored the effect of PL on 'preparedness' for leadership and an understanding of the role and ethos of the corresponding group, and the running of the programme. Results The questionnaires and interviews have shown that the programme had a positive impact on preparedness to lead, and participants described a shift in attitudes with increased understanding of the 'other' group and increased ability to work collaboratively together in the future. The 'Trainee Management Forum' was developed as a result of PL collaborative working and provides regular engagement and learning for junior doctors and managers at all levels of the organisation. Conclusion NHS Lothian PL has been impactful for those involved and is perceived to add value to the organisation, with further cohorts of doctors and managers continuing to engage with this opportunity.

AB - The complex medical environment of today calls for physicians to have an array of leadership skills in addition to a thorough knowledge of their specific practice areas. The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecologists (ACOG) Robert C. Cefalo National Leadership Institute is a 3.5-day intensive leadership development course targeted to physician leaders. A group of 37 physicians completed the ACOG National Leadership Institute in spring of 2013. At course completion and 6-month postcourse, participants were asked to complete a retrospective pre- and posttest of perceived skill levels in 10 targeted competency areas. Course completion and 6-month postcourse scores indicated statistically significant improvements in scores on all 10 competency areas, which was supported by a Wilcoxon signed-rank test of median score difference. Qualitative data gathered at the 6-month postcourse survey provide examples of how participants had applied their skills. The data presented in the current study suggested that intensive, "short-burst," experiential leadership training is an effective approach for leadership skills development in physicians.

AB - Purpose: Physician leadership programs serve to develop individual capabilities and to affect organizational outcomes. Evaluations of such programs often focus solely on short-term increases in individual capabilities. The purpose of this paper is to assess long-term individual and organizational outcomes of the Stanford Leadership Development Program. Design/methodology/approach: There are three data sources for this mixed-methods study: a follow-up survey in 2013-2014 of program participants (n=131) and matched (control) non-participants (n=82) from the 2006 to 2011 program years; promotion and retention data; and qualitative in-person interview data. The authors analyzed survey data across leadership knowledge, skills, and attitudes as well as leadership titles held, following program participation using Pearson’s χ2 test of independence. Using logistic regression, the authors analyzed promotion and retention among participants and non-participants. Finally, the authors applied both a grounded theory approach and qualitative content analysis to analyze interview data. Findings: Program participants rated higher than non-participants across 25 of 30 items measuring leadership knowledge, skills, and attitudes, and were more likely to hold regional/national leadership titles and to have gained in leadership since program participation. Asian program participants were significantly more likely than Asian non-participants to have been promoted, and women participants were less likely to have left the institution than non-participants. Finally, qualitative interviews revealed the long-term impact of leadership learning and networking, as well as the enduring, sustained impact on the organization of projects undertaken during the program. Originality/value: This study is unique in its long-term and comprehensive mixed-methods nature of evaluation to assess individual and organizational impact of a physician leadership program.

AB - Problem While leadership development is increasingly a goal of academic medicine, it is typically framed as competency acquisition, which can limit its focus to a circumscribed set of social behaviors. This orientation may also reinforce the cultural characteristics of academic medicine that can make effective leadership difficult, rather than training leaders capable of examining and changing this culture. Expanding leadership development so it promotes social reflexivity presents a way to bolster some of the weaknesses of the competency paradigm. Approach In 2013-2016, the University of Penn sylvania's Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care (DACC) carried out a leadership development program for residents, which included seminars focused on developing particular leadership skills and annual capstone sessions facilitating discussion between residents and attending physicians about topics chosen by residents. The capstone sessions proved to be most impactful, serving as forums for open conversation about how these groups interact when engaged in social behaviors such as giving/receiving feedback, offering support after an adverse event, and teaching/learning in the clinic. Outcomes The success of the capstone sessions led to a 2016 DACC-wide initiative to facilitate transparency among all professional roles (faculty, residents, nurse anesthetists, administrative staff) and encourage widespread reflexive examination about how the manner in which these groups interact encourages or impedes leadership and teamwork. Next Steps Further work is necessary to describe how leadership program formats can be diversified to better encourage reflexivity. There is also a need to develop mechanisms for assessing outcomes of leadership programs that expand outside the competency-based system.

AB - BACKGROUND: The physician manager role in the health care system is invaluable as they serve as role models and quality setters. The requirements from physician managers have become more demanding and the role less prestigious; yet burnout and its prevention in this group have received little attention. Physician leadership development programmes have generally dealt directly with skill and knowledge acquisition. The aim of this research was to evaluate an intensive workshop designed to modify attitudes and improve skills of physician-managers of community clinics, through focus on personal well-being and empowerment., METHODS: Two hundred fifty six physicians affiliated with Clalit Health Services, the largest health maintenance organization in Israel, participated in 16 IMPACT courses during the years 2013-2015. The programme comprised five full days during a two-week period, including an overnight and follow-up meetings three and six weeks later. Theoretical knowledge, experiential learning, practical tools, deep personal exercises, and simulations were conveyed through individual and group work. Topics included: models of self-awareness, outcome thinking, determining a personal and organizational vision, and creating a personal approach to leadership. At the end of each course, and by email at 6 or more months after completion of the course, participants were asked to anonymously respond to closed questions (on a scale of 1-6) and an open question., RESULTS: Mean scores for the contribution of IMPACT to participants' role of physician manager were 5.3 at the end of the course, and 4.7 at 6 or more months later. Mean scores at 6 or more months were 5.0 regarding the contribution of the programme to personal development, 4.4 regarding satisfaction in the role of physician manager, and 4.6 regarding their coping with managerial dilemmas., CONCLUSION: A workshop that focused on personal growth and self-awareness increased physicians' job satisfaction and their sense of managerial capability, coping with managerial dilemmas, and belonging to the organization.

AB - Purpose. This study measured the impact of participation by women academics in the Executive Leadership in Academic Medicine (ELAM) program as part of a robust evaluation agenda. Method. The design is a classic pre/post, within-group, self-report study. The survey elicits self-perception about leadership in ten constructs: knowledge of leadership, management, and organizational theory; environmental scanning; financial management; communication; networking and coalition building; conflict management; general leadership; assessment of strengths and weaknesses; acceptance of leadership demands; and career advancement sophistication. The post surveys inquire additionally about perceived program usefulness. Data were collected from 79 participants (1997-98, 1998-99, and 2000-01 classes). Response rates were nearly 100% (pre) and 69% to 76% (post). Results. Statistically significant increases (p < .01) in perceived leadership capabilities were identified across all ten leadership constructs. Gains were large in knowledge of leadership and organizational theory, environmental scanning, financial management, and general leadership. Gains in career building knowledge were large to moderate. More modest were gains in communication, networking, and conflict management. There were significant correlations between each leadership construct and perceived usefulness of the program. Conclusions. Significant improvements were reported on all leadership constructs, even when participants viewed themselves as already skilled. While it cannot be concluded that participation in ELAM directly and solely caused all improvements, it seems unlikely that midcareer women faculty would improve on all ten constructs in 11 months after program completion by natural maturation alone. Future research will investigate whether the changes are due to ELAM or other factors, and assess whether participants show more rapid advancement into leadership than comparable women not participating in ELAM.

AB - Despite the fact that physicians are being asked to lead and enact change to improve a myriad of quality of care measures, there is little focus on leadership skills development during their training. One strategy to address this gap is to focus on trainees during graduate medical education, specifically those residents aspiring to careers as physician leaders in quality. The authors designed a leadership curriculum for self-selected residents who are pursuing a certificate in health care leadership in quality. Residents were surveyed and focus groups were conducted with health system executives who participated in the curriculum as part of an evaluation designed to inform improvements in the program and to provide guidance to others who direct physician leadership training programs. The findings support the need to invest in young physician leaders who are focused on quality with the ultimate goal of improving population health in the ever-changing health care environment.

AB - Objectives: Challenges in healthcare demand great leadership. In response, leadership training programs have been developed within academic medical centers, business schools, and healthcare organizations; however, we are unaware of any well-developed programs for physicians-in-training. Methods: To address this gap, we developed a two-day leadership development course for chief residents (CRs) at the Cleveland Clinic, framed around the concept of emotional intelligence. This paper describes our five-year experience with the CRs leadership program. Results: Since inception, 105 CRs took the course; 81 (77%) completed before-and-after evaluations. Participants indicated that they had relatively little prior knowledge of the concepts that were presented and that the workshop greatly enhanced their familiarity with leadership competencies. Qualitative analysis of open-ended responses indicated that attendees valued the training, especially in conflict resolution and teamwork, and indicated specific action plans for applying these skills. Furthermore, the workshop spurred some participants to express plans to learn more about leadership competencies. Conclusions: This study extends prior experience in offering an emotional intelligence-based leadership workshop for CRs. Though the program is novel, further research is needed to more fully understand the impact of leadership training for CRs and for the institutions and patients they serve.

AB - background The drive towards engaging UK doctors in clinical leadership and management has involved a number of initiatives at various levels, including specific fellowships for doctors in training which enable them to take a year out of programme to work with senior leaders on service improvement or policy development projects. Objectives This paper reports on the findings of an impact evaluation of a national Fellowship Scheme for doctors in training. The evaluation aimed to determine: What were the key success factors and areas for improvement of the Scheme? How did the Fellows experience the Scheme and how has this influenced their subsequent engagement, behaviours and thinking about healthcare leadership and management? What was the perceived impact of the Scheme? Participants Six cohorts of Fellows and key stakeholders were involved in the evaluation. results The evaluation has clearly demonstrated the impact of this long-standing national Fellowship Scheme and the huge benefits for the individuals and organisations involved. For the Fellows, a national scheme such as this provides a unique experience, allowing them to learn first-hand from a range of senior decision-makers and engage in policy and strategic developments and processes. Conclusions This evaluation has demonstrated the wide impact of the Scheme but has also highlighted that more evaluations are needed of the wide range of fellowship schemes on offer to evidence broader impact, and raised issues around some of the difficulties these Fellows encounter on their return to practice in using their new skills to engage in service and healthcare improvement initiatives.

AB - Recent trends in graduate medical education have emphasized the mastery of nontechnical skills, especially leadership, for neurosurgical trainees. Accordingly, we introduced leadership development and self-awareness training to interns attending the Society of Neurological Surgeons Post-Graduate Year 1 Boot Camp in the Northeast (New England/New York/New Jersey) region in 2015. Feedback about the session was collected from interns. While neurosurgical interns conveyed a desire to receive more information on improving their leadership skills, most indicated that guidance seemed to be lacking in this critical area. We discuss some of the professional development needs uncovered during this process.Copyright © 2017 by the Congress of Neurological Surgeons.

AB - Background: Chief Residents must lead, manage and mentor a diverse and often large group of residents, however there is a lack of formal leadership training throughout graduate medical education. Objective: Development of a 3-part Chief Resident (CR) Program focused on leading, managing and mentoring. Design: Each participant completes an Emotional Intelligence (EI) Inventory prior to the daylong event. Participants receive their EI scores at the beginning of the program, which features interactive sessions on leadership, management, and feedback skills. The program then reinforces the application of their new knowledge about EI through a four station OSTE (Observed Structured Teaching Encounter). CRs practice feedback and coaching skills in a simulated environment where they need to provide the context of formative feedback to a standardized resident. Results: The aggregated mean pre-session EI score for all participants was 76.9 (an ideal score is >85). An independent-samples t-test compared the CRs' leadership and feedback performance on their first and second OSTE performance within a single afternoon session. There was a significant difference between the first OSTE performance (M = 47.92, SD = 7.8) and the second OSTE performance (M = 51.22, SD = 6.9); t (68) = 1.99, p = 0.006. These results suggest that participating in multiple OSTEs positively reinforces the core interpersonal and communication skills discussed in the didactic and practiced in the interactive portions of the program. Conclusion: The low mean pre-session EI score achieved by our participants supports the idea that CRs enter their new roles with a level of EI that can be enhanced. CRs had an overall positive reaction to EI and its application to the core skills addressed in the program, highlighting the fact that similar programs could be used to train early career physicians to be more skilled and comfortable with leading, managing and mentoring.

AB - Leadership is one of the GMC’s Generic Professional Capabilities for all medical specialties, but engagement in leadership activities is not currently routinely built into general practice (GP) training. We explored whether GP trainees in their first year of speciality training (ST1) could engage with a leadership activity in their practice placement. GP trainees were invited to participate in a voluntary leadership activity, with a small menu of optional activities to choose from. Evaluation was through electronic survey of trainees and educational supervisors (ESs) before and after the GP placement, and through trainee focus groups after the placement. 89 trainees and 191 supervisors were surveyed at the start of the trial. Trainees felt supported by supervisors and practice team members. Both groups felt that leadership skills were important for a trainee’s future career. Supervisors placed more emphasis on this than trainees. Identified barriers included lack of protected time, other training priorities, lack of empowerment, and personal issues. Most trainees and their supervisors felt that a leadership activity was possible during the first year of general practice training. More work needs to be done to see if these results are generalisable to trainees across demographic subgroups, and in other years of training.

AB - Purpose-The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of leadership development programme on enhancing leadership competencies of physicians in India. Assessment of leadership competencies of physicians is critical for designing suitable leadership development programmes. The previous studies of authors have revealed significant gaps in leadership competencies among physicians in India. Hence, authors have designed a programme incorporating various facets of health-care leadership and evaluated its impact on improvement of leadership competencies of top-and mid-career level professionals. Design/methodology/approach-A six-day offsite residential programme incorporating a three-day component of leadership development was organized, in which 96 physicians participated. A mix of pedagogical approaches was used. A pre-and post-assessment of 30 medical leadership competencies was done using a self-administered questionnaire. Findings-Majority of participants (69%) scored their competencies at Level 3 and Level 4 (Average to Good) with a mean score ranging from 3.20 6 0.85 to 4.12 6 0.71 in the pre-assessment group. In contrast, in post-assessment, this shifted to Level 4 and Level 5 (Good to Very good) in 72% with mean scores ranging from 3.8 to 4.24. Statistically significant differentiation was noted in pre-and post-assessment mean scores for all 30 competencies. The maximum improvement was noted in Competency 29 "Information management system planning and implementation", whereas the least improvement was noted in Competency 12 "Holding self and others accountable and responsible for organizational goal attainment". Originality/value-The authors believe that this is the first study from India to assess effectiveness of leadership development programmes on enhancing medical leadership competencies demonstrating positive outcome. The findings of this study can provide a roadmap for designing of future medical leadership development programmes for physicians in India.

AB - BACKGROUND: Medical residents are often responsible for leading and performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation; however, their levels of expertise and comfort as leaders of advanced cardiovascular life support (ACLS) teams vary widely. While the current American Heart Association ACLS course provides education in recommended resuscitative protocols, training in leadership skills is insufficient. In this article, we describe the design and implementation in our institution of a formative curriculum aimed at improving residents' readiness for being leaders of ACLS teams using human patient simulation. Human patient simulation refers to a variety of technologies using mannequins with realistic features, which allows learners to practice through scenarios without putting patients at risk. We discuss the limitations of the program and the challenges encountered in implementation. We also provide a description of the initiation and organization of the program. Case scenarios and assessment tools are provided. DESCRIPTION OF THE INSTITUTIONAL TRAINING PROGRAM: Our simulation-based training curriculum consists of 8 simulated patient scenarios during four 1-hour sessions. Postgraduate year-2 and 3 internal medicine residents participate in this program in teams of 4. Assessment tools are utilized only for formative evaluation. Debriefing is used as a teaching strategy for the individual resident leader of the ACLS team to facilitate learning and improve performance. To evaluate the impact of the curriculum, we administered a survey before and after the intervention. The survey consisted of 10 questions answered on a 5-point Likert scale, which addressed residents' confidence in leading ACLS teams, management of the equipment, and management of cardiac rhythms. Respondents' mean presimulation (ie, baseline) and postsimulation (ie, outcome) scores were compared using a 2-sample t test. Residents' overall confidence score improved from 2.8 to 3.9 (P < 0.001; mean improvement, 1.1; 95% confidence interval, 0.7-1.6). The average score for performing and leading ACLS teams improved from 2.8 to 4 (P < 0.001; mean difference, 1.2; 95% confidence interval, 0.7-1.7). There was a uniform increase in the residents' self-confidence in their role as effective leaders of ACLS teams, and residents valued this simulation-based training program.

AB - Objectives To report on the extent to which a general practice specialty trainee integrated training placement (ITP) developed the leadership skills and knowledge of general practice specialty trainees (GPSTRs) and on the potential of the ITP to improve clinical engagement. Design A case study method was used in a Kent primary care trust (PCT). Sources of data included face-to-face and telephone interviews (three GPSTRs, three PCT clinical supervisors, three general practitioner (GP) clinical supervisors and diree Deanery/PCT managers), reflective diaries, documentary sources and observation. Interview data were transcribed and analysed using the constant comparative method. Results All respondents were positive about the value and success of the ITP in developing the leadership skills of the GPSTRs covering three dimensions: leadership of self, leadership of teams and leadership of organisations within systems. The ITP had enabled GP trainees to understand the context for change, to develop skills to set the direction for change and to collect and apply evi-dence to decision making. The ITP was described as an effective means of breaking down cultural barriers between general practice and the PCT and as having the potential for improving clinical engagement. Conclusions The ITP provided a model to enable the effective exchange of knowledge and understanding of differing cultures between GPSTRs, general practice and the PCT. It provided a sound basis for effective, dispersed clinical engagement and leadership. © 2010 Radcliffe Publishing.

AB - A great deal of time and resources go into the development and training of neurosurgeons. One area that has minimal literature and assessment is leadership development. Under the core competency of interpersonal and communication skills, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education has indicated that residents are expected to work effectively as a member or leader of a healthcare team. This article reveals how a structured leadership program was developed so that residents are better prepared for the role of chief resident and future leadership roles. Beginning in October 2006, residents attended a series of 1-hour workshops conducted monthly. Topics included leadership style, conflict management, effective feedback, team building, team leadership, motivation, and moving from peer to leader. A retrospective pretest was conducted at the end of the program. Residents reported a significant knowledge gain for the majority of topics. Resident comments indicated a greater awareness of the impact of leading and ways to improve their personal leadership. Quantitatively and qualitatively, residents and faculty reported that the leadership program made a significant impact on the development of future neurosurgical leaders.

AB - Pediatric hematologist/oncologists lead in a variety of roles and settings: at the bedside, in private or academic practice, in the laboratory, and in wider society. Whether their leadership is the result of innate ability, technical expertise, or educational experience, patients, colleagues, academic centers, and communities turn to physicians for leadership. But where do these physicians learn this complex skill? Physicians do acquire leadership skills, but mainly through interaction with role models and in a hit or miss fashion. This article provides a theoretical framework for medical leadership education and describes a leadership-focused educational seminar that has been offered to pediatric hematology-oncology fellows at Texas Children's Cancer Center since 1995. Retrospective pre/post evaluations by fellows indicated significant improvement in self-rated ability for all 24 dimensions assessed, including a variety of items drawn from the roster of the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education Core Competencies. In this article we extend the concept of physician leadership from its roots in practice and present a comprehensive model that prepares pediatric hematologist/oncologists for leadership in clinical, research, and educational arenas.

AB - Objective: The authors describe a course designed for residents to develop the knowledge and skills necessary to collaborate and successfully compete in today's complex health care environment and to achieve competency in systems-based practice. Methods: Postgraduation surveys demonstrated a need for improvement in preparing residents for practice management issues. The authors outline a 32-week practice management curriculum for postgraduate-year 3 (PGY3) psychiatric residents. Results: The course was rated highly by residents in terms of topics covered, faculty involvement, and overall expectations. The project assignments completed by the residents were effective in creating objective change in the resident outpatient practice. Conclusion: Practice management is an essential part of residency training and can be successfully integrated into the residents' clinical practice experience. Future steps include assessment of the graduates at 1 and 5 years postgraduation to evaluate the long-term efficacy of the course. Copyright © 2009 Academic Psychiatry.

AB - In 2003, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center (DHMC) inaugurated its Leadership Preventive Medicine residency (DHLPMR), which combines two years of leadership preventive medicine (LPM) training with another DHMC residency. The aim of DHLPMR is to attract and develop physicians who seek to become capable of leading change and improvement of the systems where people and health care meet. The capabilities learned by residents are (1) leadership-including design and redesign-of small systems in health care, (2) measurement of illness burden in individuals and populations, (3) measurement of the outcomes of health service interventions, (4) leadership of change for improvement of quality, value, and safety of health care of individuals and populations, and (5) reflection on personal professional practice enabling personal and professional development. The DHLPMR program includes completion of an MPH degree at The Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice (formerly the Center for Evaluative Clinical Sciences) and a practicum during which the resident leads change to improve health care for a defined population of patients. Residents also complete a longitudinal public health experience in a governmental public health agency. A coach in the resident's home clinical department helps the resident develop his or her practicum proposal, which must then be approved by a practicum review board (PRB). Twelve residents have graduated as of July 2007. Residents have combined anesthesia, family medicine, internal medicine, infectious disease, pain medicine, pathology, psychiatry, pulmonary and critical care medicine, surgery, gastroenterology, geriatric psychiatry, obstetrics-gynecology, and pediatrics with preventive medicine. © 2008 Association of American Medical Colleges.

AB - Objective: The purpose of this project was to develop a seminar on women as leaders within an academic department of psychiatry and to evaluate its effectiveness. Methods: A seminar was offered as an elective to all residents within the Yale University Department of Psychiatry. Didactic presentations and open discussion were structured around the following topics: 1) exploration of leadership roles in various areas, including research, clinical practice, teaching, and administration; 2) organizational dynamics and gender; 3) negotiation skills and conflict resolution strategies; 4) role of consultation, seminars, peer support and mentoring by both men and women in the development of leadership skills; and 5) "keeping the balance: work, relationships, and personal health." The 13 participants were queried at the completion of the seminar, and a follow-up survey was performed 18 months later. Results: The initial and follow-up evaluations were quite positive, with average ratings in the "excellent" range at both points. The 10 respondents at 18 months were unanimous that there had been a positive and lasting effect on their professional lives. Conclusion: A seminar on women as leaders was a successful venture within an academic department of psychiatry. The structure of the course, which incorporated specific teaching materials plus "local" expertise, could serve as a model for such seminars in other programs or could be integrated into an existing course for all residents.

AB - Background. The work environment and characteristics and behaviors of leaders are key components to successful programs. Pediatric primary care education has suffered from a lack of effective leaders. Objective. The Executive Leadership Track of the Health Services Resources Adinistration - Ambulatory Pediatrics Association (HRSA-APA) National Faculty Development Scholars Program was designed to develop a cadre of teaching faculty with the knowledge, attitudes, and skills to lead primary care faculty development efforts in their home intitutions, regions, and the nation. Methods. Senior faculty from each APA region were selected to participate in a basic series of three 2-day leadership workshops. Three workshops addressed topics shown to be essential to development of productive work enviroments, 3 emphasized career development, and 3 addressed development of effective administrative skills. Participants were expected to give at least one workshop in their home institution or region every 6 months. Outcome measures included number of scholars successfully completing the program, number of workshops given by scholars, number of participants in scholars' workshops, indicators of professional growth, and indicators of changes in their work environment that support medical education and teaching. Results. Thirty-two scholars conducted 90 workshops attended by 1082 participants. Scholars reported professional accomplishment, including assuming positions of leadership and promotion. Changes to the scholars' work environment included increased emphasis on educational scholarship in promotion and tenure considerations, mission-based budgeting and closer collaboration between academic and community faculty. Conclusion. The program participants became effective leaders of and advocates for medical education.

AB - Objective. Development of leadership competencies has become a priority for many academic health science centers. However, traditional faculty development has focused almost exclusively on improving teaching skills. The process and outcomes of developing leadership skills for academic health science center faculty has not been extensively studied. Methods. The University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC) created a year-long course, called the Administrative Colloquium, as a means to enhance faculty leadership skills. Completion of the course required attendance at 8 half-day workshop sessions, each devoted to teaching a leadership competency (eg, leading with vision, managing change) and completing a project with a project report (oral or poster presentation). Course evaluation was multifaceted. Attendees were queried multiple times by a pre- and poststrategy and retrospective pre- and poststrategy concerning their perceptions about knowledge obtained during the course. Paired t testing was used to determine statistical differences between the mean pre- versus postvalues and the retrospective pre- versus postvalues. Project content was qualitatively analyzed for themes. Results. All comparisons of pre- and postdata and retrospective pre- and postdata were statistically significant (P < .05). Three themes arose from the analysis of projects: change, management, and interpersonal communications. Conclusions. The pre- and postknowledge data and the retrospective pre- and postknowledge data demonstrate that learning was significant as well as sustained. Qualitative analysis of the project content demonstrates that the participants were applying the course content to solving real-world problems. These results give preliminary support to the conclusion that the Administrative Colloquium has had an impact on faculty leadership development at UNMC.

AB - Female physicians have less influence over their daily work conditions and exhibit slower career advancement as compared to their male colleagues. The aim of this study is to assess the impact on individual and organizational well being from different kinds of management programs. Female physicians participating in management intervention programs were compared with a reference group of matched physicians and sickness absenteeism was significantly lower in the intervention group. No significant differences were found between the groups with regard to career advancement, individual, organizational and professional well being. Health care organizations spend a substantial amount of resources on management programs in order to improve leadership, autonomy and the work-environment of physicians in times of increasing discontent among this key group of health care employees. Our study indicates some beneficial health effects from structured management programs but there is a need to develop and assess the efficacy of these programs further. © 2004, Emerald Group Publishing Limited

AB - Chief residents (CRs) play a crucial role in training residents and students but may have limited geriatrics training or formal preparation for their CR role. A 2-day off-site chief resident immersion training (CRIT) addressed these challenges. Objectives were to foster collaboration between disciplines in the management of complex older patients, increase knowledge of geriatrics principles to incorporate into teaching, enhance leadership skills, and help CRs develop an achievable project for implementation in their CR year. Three cohorts totaling 47 trainees and 18 faculty mentors from 13 medical and surgical disciplines participated over 3 successive years. The curriculum, developed and taught by a multidisciplinary team, featured an interactive surgical case, mini-lectures on geriatrics topics, seminars to enhance teaching and leadership skills, and one-on-one mentoring to develop a project in geriatric care or education. Evaluation included pre- and postprogram tests and self-report surveys and two follow-up surveys or interviews. In 2006 and 2007, scores on a 12-item objective knowledge test increased significantly (P<.001) from before to immediately after CRIT. Self-report knowledge and confidence in teaching geriatrics also increased significantly (P<.05) in all formally covered topics. Mean enhancement of CR skills was 4.3 (1=not at all, 5=very much). Eleven months after CRIT, all but five CRs had implemented at least part of their action projects. CRs reported improved care of older patients, better leadership skills, more and better geriatrics teaching, and more collaboration between disciplines. A 2-day interactive program for CRs can increase institutional capacity regarding geriatrics teaching and care of elderly patients across medical specialties. © 2008, Copyright the Authors.

AB - Context. - Management of laboratories and pathology practices is increasingly complex. Residents and fellows in laboratory medicine and pathology need more structured curricula in leadership and management (L&M) training to function as medical and laboratory directors. Objective. - To define a curriculum that provides basic competency in L&M for residents and fellows in pathology. Design. - A year-long formal L&M course included didactic lectures, interactive sessions, case scenarios, team-building exercises, formal team presentations (capstone project), and precourse and postcourse assessment of L&M knowledge. The curriculum meets requirements of American College of Graduate Medical Education and supports goals for leadership training of the College of American Pathologists. Participants evaluated (5-point scale) the content and speakers of all sessions. Trainees were evaluated after considering postcourse examination results, quality of the capstone presentation, and a global assessment. Results. - The 5 non-capstone sessions received evaluation scores ranging from 4.4 (informatics) to 5 (L&M basics). Postcourse test scores showed significant improvement when compared with the pretest scores for the 2003-2004 and 2004-2005 trainee cohorts. Conclusions. - Short-term results indicate that the course described improves trainee knowledge of L&M issues.

AB - Background: In Australia and New Zealand, surgical trainees are expected to develop competencies across 9 domains. Although structured training is provided in several domains, there is little or no formal program for professionalism, communication, collaboration, and management and leadership. The Australian federal Department of Health and Aging funded a pilot course in simulation-based education to address these competencies for surgical trainees. This article describes the course and evaluation. Methods: Course development: Content and methods drew on best-evidence for teaching and learning these competencies from other disciplines. Course evaluation: Participants completed surveys using rating scales and free text comments to identify aspects of the course that worked well and those that needed improvement. Results: Eleven of 12 participants completed evaluation forms immediately after the course. Participants reported largely meeting learning objectives and valuing the educational methods. High levels of realism in simulations contributed to the ease with which participants immersed themselves in scenarios. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that a course designed to teach competencies in communication, teamwork, leadership, and the encompassing professionalism to surgical trainees is feasible. Although participants valued the content and methods, they identified areas for development. Limitations of the evaluation are highlighted, and further areas for research are identified. © 2012 Association of Program Directors in Surgery.

AB - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this report is to describe and evaluate the impact of a 1-day retreat focused on developing leadership skills and teambuildlng among postgraduate year 1 residents in an internal medicine residency. METHOD: A group of organizers, including members of the staff, the chief medical residents, administrative individuals in the residency office, and an internal organizational development consultant convened to organize an off-site retreat with activities that would provide experiential learning regarding teamwork and leadership, including a "reef survival exercise" and table discussions regarding the characteristics of ideal leaders. In addition, several energizing activities and recreational free time was provided to enhance the interaction and teamwork dimensions of the retreat. To evaluate the impact of the retreat, attendees completed baseline and follow-up questionnaires regarding their experience of the retreat. RESULTS: Attendees universally regarded the retreat as having value for them. Comparison of baseline to postretreat responses indicated that attendees felt that the retreat enhanced their abilities to be better physicians, resident supervisors, and leaders. Follow-up responses indicated significant increases in attendees' agreement that good leaders challenge the process, make decisions based on shared visions, allow others to act, recognize individual contributions, and serve as good role models. Results on the survival exercise indicated a high frequency with which team-based decisions surpassed individual members' decisions, highlighting the importance and value of teamwork to attendees. CONCLUSIONS: Out main findings were that: participants universally found this 1-day retreat beneficial in helping to develop teamwork and leadership skills and the experiential learning aspects of the retreat were more especially highly rated and highlighted the advantages of teamwork. In the context that this 1-day retreat was deemed useful by faculty and residents alike, further study is needed to assess the impact of this learning on actual clinical practice and the durability of these lessons.

AB - Today's complex health care environment coupled with the 80-hour workweek mandate has required that surgical resident team interactions evolve from a military command-and-control style to a collaborative leadership style. A novel educational curriculum was implemented with objectives of training the residents to have the capacity/ability to create and manage powerful teams through alignment, communication, and integrity integral tools to practicing a collaborative leadership style while working 80 hours per week. Specific strategies were as follows: (1) to focus on quality of patient care and service while receiving a high education-to-service ratio, and (2) to maximize efficiency through time management. This article shows that leadership training as part of a resident curriculum can significantly increase a resident's view of leadership in the areas of alignment, communication, and integrity; tools previously shown in business models to be vital for effective and efficient teams. This curriculum, over the course of the surgical residency, can provide residents with the necessary tools to deliver efficient quality of care while working within the 80-hour workweek mandate in a more collaborative style environment. © 2004 Excerpta Medica Inc.

AB - As the healthcare system continues to change, healthcare professionals will need to assume an increasing number of administrative and management responsibilities. The goal of this article is to describe a two-day workshop on Executive Skills for Medical Faculty and the results of an evaluation conducted one year later. This workshop consisted of specific modules on analyzing time-management skills, determining goals and priorities, improving time-management strategies, assessing leadership styles and skills, and conducting effective meetings. The workshop evaluation consisted of an immediate post-workshop questionnaire administered to all of the participants, and semistructured interviews, conducted on the telephone, with half of the attendees. Both evaluations were designed to assess perceptions of the workshop's usefulness and areas of individual change. Feedback from the participants immediately after the workshop indicated an overall satisfaction with the workshop content and methodology and a desire to try new time-management strategies. Evaluation of the workshop one year later indicated that the majority of the participants had determined their priorities more clearly, altered their time-management strategies, and planned more effective meetings. Less change was noted in the area of leadership styles and skills. Both the immediate and delayed workshop evaluations indicated that the most useful sessions were those devoted to determining goals and priorities, time management and effective meetings. These results suggest that a two-day workshop can improve health care professionals' administrative and management skills in certain areas. A longer workshop and built-in 'follow-up' activities would enhance the potential for change.

AB - Talent management and leadership development is becoming a necessity for health care organizations. These leaders will be needed to manage the change in the delivery of health care and payment systems. Appointment of clinically skilled physicians as leaders without specific training in the areas described in our program could lead to failure. A comprehensive program such as the one described is also needed for succession planning and retaining high-potential individuals in an era of shortage of surgeons. © 2014 by the Society for Vascular Surgery.

AB - Background: Effective physician leadership is critical to the future success of healthcare organizations. The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) Leadership Fellows Program is a one-year program designed to train young orthopaedic surgeons to become future leaders in orthopaedics. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of the AAOS Leadership Fellows Program on the leadership skills and achievements of its participants. Methods: Graduates of the Leadership Fellows Program were compared with a control group of previous applicants who were not accepted to the program (applicants) in a retrospective cohort comparison study. A subjective survey of leadership skills was used to assess the confidence of the two cohorts in eight areas of leadership. In addition, an updated curriculum vitae from each of sixty leadership fellows from the classes of 2003 through 2009 and from each of forty-seven applicants was retrospectively reviewed for evidence of leadership. The updated curriculum vitae of the leadership fellows was evaluated for leadership activity attained prior to and following participation in the program, while the updated curriculum vitae of applicants was evaluated for leadership activity attained prior to and following the last year of application to the program. Curricula vitae were assessed for demonstration of national leadership, academic rank, hospital administrative rank, and research experience. Results: On the leadership survey, the graduates of the Leadership Fellows Program scored higher than the applicants in seven of eight categories. The review of the curricula vitae demonstrated that, prior to the Leadership Fellows Program, the leadership fellows were more likely than the applicants to have an academic practice and hold an academic rank. The difference between the two cohorts in administrative rank and leadership of national committees was not significant. Following the program, the leadership fellows were more likely to chair national committees (p < 0.001) and hold leadership positions in their hospitals (p = 0.008). Furthermore, the leadership fellows were more likely to advance in their academic and administrative ranks compared with those who applied to the program and were not accepted. Conclusions: The AAOS Leadership Fellows Program seems to have a positive impact on the leadership competency of its participants. Graduates of the program are more likely to assume leadership positions in national organizations and within their own institutions. Level of Evidence: Therapeutic Level III.

AB - Purpose The paper aims to describe an evaluation study of advanced leadership programmes run for clinical leaders in the National Health Service (NHS) in England. Design/methodology/approach This was a limited, posthoc study, strongly influenced by a “moving target” problem, which collected and analysed reaction and learninglevel data through email questionnaires, document analysis and semistructured interviews. Findings Significant underlying unchecked assumptions in relation to the programmes were made and were never realised in practice. There were split funding arrangements and lack of clarity over the purpose of the programmes. While there were organisational and individual benefits achieved the programmes only partly met their original objectives. Research limitations/implications The posthoc nature of the research study was a major limitation, together with the “bespoke” nature of programme delivery, This meant that the findings of the study were broad and general, rather than specific to each individual programme. Future evaluation studies would need to be planned with the programme design, rather than as an afterthought. Practical implications Robust project management arrangements are necessary for steering purposes in such complex leadership development programmes. A continuing diagnostic orientation is needed on the part of the programme provider. Programme titles matter – and create expectations. The contractual model potentially creates tensions between client(s) and provider. Originality/value Few evaluation studies of clinical leadership programmes have been conducted and reported. The case study offers a rich source of shared learning with regard to the complexity and challenges in this sphere. © 2009, Emerald Group Publishing Limited

AB - Purpose: The implementation of interdisciplinary teams in the intensive care unit (ICU) has focused attention on leadership behavior. Daily interdisciplinary rounds (IDRs) in ICUs integrate leadership behavior and interdisciplinary teamwork. The purpose of this intervention study was to measure the effect of leadership training on the quality of IDRs in the ICU. Methods: A nonrandomized intervention study was conducted in four ICUs for adults. The intervention was a 1-day training session in a simulation environment and workplace-based feedback sessions. Measurement included 28 videotaped IDRs (total, 297 patient presentations) that were assessed with 10 essential quality indicators of the validated IDR Assessment Scale. Participants were 19 intensivists who previously had no formal training in leading IDRs. They were subdivided by cluster sampling into a control group (ten experienced intensivists) and intervention group (nine intensive care fellows). Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare results between control and intervention groups. Results: Baseline measurements of control and intervention groups revealed two indicators that differed significantly. The frequency of yes ratings for the intervention group significantly increased for seven of the ten indicators from before to after intervention. The frequency of yes ratings after training was significantly greater in the intervention than control groups for eight of the ten essential quality indicators. Conclusions: The leadership training improved the quality of the IDRs performed in the ICUs. This may improve quality and safety of patient care. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg and ESICM.

AB - Introduction: Due to a limited health workforce, many health care providers in Africa must take on health leadership roles with minimal formal training in leadership. Hence, the need to equip health care providers with practical skills required to lead high-impact health care programs. In Uganda, the Afya Bora Global Health Leadership Fellowship is implemented through the Makerere University College of Health Sciences (MakCHS) and her partner institutions. Lessons learned from the program, presented in this paper, may guide development of in-service training opportunities to enhance leadership skills of health workers in resource-limited settings. Methods: The Afya Bora Consortium, a consortium of four African and four U.S. academic institutions, offers 1-year global health leadership-training opportunities for nurses and doctors. Applications are received and vetted internationally by members of the consortium institutions in Botswana, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and the USA. Fellows have 3 months of didactic modules and 9 months of mentored field attachment with 80% time dedicated to fellowship activities. Fellows' projects and experiences, documented during weekly mentor-fellow meetings and monthly mentoring team meetings, were compiled and analyzed manually using pre-determined themes to assess the effect of the program on fellows' daily leadership opportunities. Results: Between January 2011 and January 2015, 15 Ugandan fellows (nine doctors and six nurses) participated in the program. Each fellow received 8 weeks of didactic modules held at one of the African partner institutions and three online modules to enhance fellows' foundation in leadership, communication, monitoring and evaluation, health informatics, research methodology, grant writing, implementation science, and responsible conduct of research. In addition, fellows embarked on innovative projects that covered a wide spectrum of global health challenges including critical analysis of policy formulation and review processes, bottlenecks in implementation of national HIV early infant diagnosis and prevention of mother-to-child HIV-transmission programs, and use of routine laboratory data about antibiotic resistance to guide updates of essential drug lists. Conclusion: In-service leadership training was feasible, with ensured protected time for fellows to generate evidence-based solutions to challenges within their work environment. With structured mentorship, collaborative activities at academic institutions and local health care programs equipped health care providers with leadership skills.

AB - Background: Effective clinical leadership is associated with better patient care. We implemented and evaluated pilot clinical leadership course for second year internal medicine residents at a large United States Academi Medical Center that is part of a multi-hospital health system Methods: The course met weekly for two to three hours during July, 2013. Sessions included large grou discussions and small group reflection meetings. Topics included leadership styles, emotional intelligence, an leading clinical teams. Course materials were designed internally and featured "business school style" case studie about everyday clinical medicine which explore how leadership skills impact care delivery. Participants evaluate the course's impact and quality using a post-course survey. Questions were structured in five point likert scale an free text format. Likert scale responses were converted to a 1-5 scale (1 = strongly disagree; 3 = neither agree no disagree; 5 = strongly agree), and means were compared to the value 3 using one-way T-Tests. Responses to fre text questions were analyzed using the constant comparative method Results: All sixteen pilot course participants completed the survey. Participants overwhelmingly agreed that th course provided content and skills relevant to their clinical responsibilities and leadership roles. Most participant also acknowledged that taking the course improved their understanding of their strengths and weaknesses a leaders, different leadership styles, and how to manage interpersonal conflict on clinical teams. 88% also reporte that the course increased their interest in pursuing additional leadership training Conclusions: A clinical leadership course for internal medicine residents designed by colleagues, and utilizing cas studies about clinical medicine, resulted in significant self-reported improvements in clinical leadership competencies.

AB - In the usual process of leadership development, the evolving leader rarely interacts with the CEO of the organization outside of the top leader's formal role in meetings and presentations. That is not the case at Geisinger Health System in Pennsylvania, where the CEO and other leaders share unique, personal, case-based wisdom with evolving leaders. Although the CEO plays the pivotal role in this program, a neutral expert is required for the program to be successful. In Geisinger's leadership development program, this person introduced the program goals, provided a brief overview of the academic models of leadership and oriented the group to case-based learning for those who were unfamiliar with it. The participants expressed enthusiasm for the case-based method, especially among the physician group, many of whom had not had prior experience with this teaching method. The opportunity to engage evolving leaders in open discussion gave the CEO first-hand appreciation of the leadership potential of each participant.

AB - The dynamic and rapidly changing health care environment has led to the convergence of business and medicine. As a result, clinicians and administrators can no longer operate separately. To that end, the University of Cincinnati has provided the educational and developmental opportunity for physicians to undergo the professional and personal changes necessary to develop and perform as effective leaders. The program was funded by Humana Inc, for a five-year period and was offered to community practice physicians in the Greater Cincinnati area and included Northern Kentucky and part of Indiana. The program addressed a community and national need for physician leaders. The University of Cincinnati physician leadership program served for five years as an effective community resource for physician leadership development. Self-assessment of health care leadership competencies at entry and exit provided the reporting of participants' perceptions resulting in an understanding of the program's impact.

AB - Objective: The authors describe a pilot physician-manager curriculum designed to address the learning needs of psychiatric residents in administrative psychiatry and health systems. Methods: The pilot curriculum includes a junior and a senior toolkit of four workshops each. The junior toolkit introduces postgraduate-year two (PGY-2) residents to the principles of teamwork, conflict resolution, quality improvement, and program planning and evaluation. The senior toolkit exposes PGY-4 residents to leadership and change management, organizational structures, mental health and addictions reform, and self and career development. Following curriculum implementation at the University of Toronto, residents rated the importance and clinical relevance of curriculum objectives and commented on the strengths and weaknesses of the workshops and areas needing improvement. Results: The pilot curriculum was successfully introduced at the University of Toronto in 2006. Residents rated the curriculum very highly and commented that interactive learning and contex-tually relevant topics are essential in meeting their needs. Conclusion: It is possible to successfully introduce a physician-manager curriculum early during psychiatric residency training, to match the specific needs of clinical rotations. Interactive techniques and clinical illustrations may be crucial in facilitating teaching and learning the physician-manager role. The authors discuss barriers, facilitators, and critical success factors in implementing such a curriculum. Copyright © 2009 Academic Psychiatry.

AB - We developed a training program to introduce managers and informal leaders of healthcare organizations to key concepts of teamwork, safety leadership, and simulation to motivate them to act as leaders to improve safety within their sphere of influence. This report describes the simulation scenario and debriefing that are core elements of that program. Twelve teams of clinician and nonclinician managers were selected from a larger set of volunteers to participate in a 1-day, multielement training program. Two simulation exercises were developed: one for teams of nonclinicians and the other for clinicians or mixed groups. The scenarios represented two different clinical situations, each designed to engage participants in discussions of their safety leadership and teamwork issues immediately after the experience. In the scenarios for nonclinicians, participants conducted an anesthetic induction and then managed an ethical situation. The scenario for clinicians simulated a consulting visit to an emergency room that evolved into a problem-solving challenge. Participants in this scenario had a limited time to prepare advice for hospital leadership on how to improve observed safety and cultural deficiencies. Debriefings after both types of scenarios were conducted using principles of "debriefing with good judgment." We assessed the relevance and impact of the program by analyzing participant reactions to the simulation through transcript data and facilitator observations as well as a postcourse questionnaire. The teams generally reported positive perceptions of the relevance and quality of the simulation with varying types and degrees of impact on their leadership and teamwork behaviors. These kinds of clinical simulation exercises can be used to teach healthcare leaders and managers safety leadership and teamwork skills and behaviors.

AB - Background: Developing effective transformational leaders is essential for a diverse and complex academic medical system. The purpose of this study is to elicit faculty perspectives on their leadership skills before and after participation in a Leadership in Academic Medicine (LAM) Program. Summary: The two-part study consisted of a prospective Pre- and Immediate Post-LAM Survey distributed to 32 participants in the 2008 Program and a Long-Term Post-LAM Survey distributed to 110 prior participants (2004-2007). Both surveys were designed to assess participant leadership perspectives and career outcomes. Institutional Review Board approval was obtained. Data were analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively. All participants reported improved leadership skills, but the percentages were lower for Long-Term Post-LAM participants than for the Immediate Post-LAM participants. In addition, although 58% of Immediate Post-LAM women, compared with 19% of Immediate Post-LAM men (p &.05), were actively seeking leadership roles, this was reversed in the long-term group (26% of women vs. 66% of men; p &.05). Conclusions: Although the benefits of LAM participation are sustained for some years, there is a need for reinforcement to prevent skill attrition. That lower percentages of Long-Term Post-LAM women had leadership aspirations requires further study. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB - Rationale and Objectives: To better prepare radiology residents for providing care within the context of the larger health care system, this study evaluated the feasibility and impact of a curriculum to enhance radiology residents' understanding and ability to apply concepts from medical management and industrial and operational engineering to systems-based practice problems in radiology practice. Materials and Methods: A multiprofessional team including radiology, medical education, and industrial and operational engineering professionals collaborated in developing a seven-module curriculum, including didactic lectures, interactive large-group analysis, and small-group discussions with case-based radiology examples, which illustrated real-life management issues and the roles physicians held. Residents and faculty participated in topic selection. Pre- and post-instruction formative assessments were administered, and results were shared with residents during teaching sessions. Results: Attendance and participation in case-based scenario resolutions indicate the feasibility and impact of the interactive curriculum on residents' interest and ability to apply curricular concepts to systems-based practice in radiology. Paired t test analyses (P <.05) and effect sizes showed residents significantly increased their knowledge and ability to apply concepts to systems-based practice issues in radiology. Conclusions: Our iterative curriculum development and implementation process demonstrated need and support for a multiprofessional team approach to teach management and operational engineering concepts. Curriculum topics are congruent with Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education requirements for systems-based practice. The case-based curriculum using a mixed educational format of didactic lectures and small-group discussion and problem analysis could be adopted for other radiology programs, for both residents and continuing medical education applications. © 2013 AUR.

AB - Purpose - The purpose of this article is to study the impact of two leadership programmes for healthcare managers regarding their attitudes to, and views on, their leadership. Design/methodology/approach - A total of 53 managers participated in two different leadership programmes i.e. one-week (OW-DGL) intensive leadership course and long-term support groups. Of those, 39 (74 per cent) responded to the Wheel Questionnaire, both soon before and six months after the end of their respective leadership programmes. Overall, eight focus group interviews were conducted, and the data were analysed through content analysis. Findings - Both leadership programmes seem to have strengthened the managers in their leadership roles. The OW-DGL course supported the managers in learning about group dynamics and relationship-orientated leadership. The programmes' methods differed, but the conclusion is that they complemented each other. The long-term support groups helped the managers to structure and cope with everyday leadership situations in their occupational environment. Practical implications - The OW-DGL course was found to be good for inexperienced managers and the long-term support groups for more experienced managers. Originality/value - There is a lack of intervention studies regarding the efficacy of leadership programmes directed toward managers in health care. Two different approaches to leadership training are compared in this paper, using both quantitative and qualitative methods. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: To optimize health and well-being for all older people, we must collectively develop leaders to pioneer models of care, educate the healthcare workforce, advance research, and engage the community. METHODS: The Emerging Leaders in Aging (ELIA) program was created to train a multiprofessional cadre of leaders focused on the health and well-being of older people. ELIA uses the social change curricular framework and addresses knowledge of self, community, and engagement with change. Program impact measured included scholar satisfaction, confidence related to curricular domains before and after the program, project progress, and scholar productivity. RESULTS: Four cohorts of 65 scholars in seven health professions from 24 states were selected for the year-long 55-hour program. Overall satisfaction from members of the first three cohorts who have completed the program (n = 46) was 4.86 (scale = 1–5), and scholar confidence increased from 5.8 to 8.0 (scale = 1–9) (p <.001). These scholars reported 85 presentations, 63 publications, and 21 awards subsequent to training. All scholars described the importance of a program focused on early and mid-career leaders in health and aging. DISCUSSION: The ELIA program leverages longitudinal, distance mentor communities, and project-based learning strategies. It has improved confidence and skills in emerging leaders who commit their efforts toward the care of older persons. Programs like ELIA are critical to preparing a healthcare workforce to optimize care for all as our health needs and expectations change with age. J Am Geriatr Soc 67:437–442, 2019.

AB - Background: The importance of leadership development in the early stages of careers in the NHS has been highlighted in recent years and many programmes have been implemented which seek to develop leadership skills in healthcare professionals. The Improving Global Health (IGH) Fellowship scheme is one such programme, it provides a unique leadership development opportunity through an overseas placement with a focus on quality improvement work. This evaluation examines the impact of completing an IGH Fellowship on the career and leadership development of participants, who are referred to as Fellows. Methods: Fellows who had returned from overseas placement between August 2008 and February 2015 were invited to complete an anonymised online questionnaire, which collected information on: demographic details, motivations for applying to the programme, leadership development and the impact of the IGH Fellowship on their career. Fifteen semi-structured interviews were conducted to further explore the impact of the programme on Fellows' leadership development and career progression. Interview transcripts were manually coded and underwent thematic content analysis. Results: The questionnaire had a 67% (74/111) response rate. The number of fellows who self-identified as a leader more than doubled on completion of the IGH Fellowship (24/74 pre-fellowship versus 58/74 post-fellowship). 74% (55/74) reported that the IGH Fellowship had an impact upon their career, 35 of which reported that the impact was "substantial". The themes that emerged from the interviews revealed a personal development cycle that consolidated the fellows' interests and values whilst enhancing their self-efficacy and subsequently impacted positively upon their career choices. Three interviewees expressed frustration at the lack of opportunity to utilise their new skills on returning to the United Kingdom (UK). Conclusions: The IGH Fellowship successfully empowered healthcare professionals to self-identify as leaders. Of the 45/74 respondents who commented on the impact of the IGH Fellowship on their career, 41/45 comments were positive. The fellows described a process of experiential learning, reflection and evolving cultural intelligence, which consolidated their interests and values. The resultant increase in self-efficacy empowered these returned fellows in their choice of career.

AB - Reforming healthcare has been a priority in the United States for many years. A major part of that reform has been an expansion in the role and duties of physicians to include more management and leadership within the organization. This type of reform requires innovative changes in health science education programs. Traditionally, physician leaders were vice-presidents of medical affairs, chief medical officers, chief physicians, or head doctors. They served in advisory roles with limited responsibility and no financial authority and were unable to establish policies and make changes that systematically affected the administration and delivery of services within the organization. Out of necessity, the role of the physician leader has changed to include the following components: leading change efforts, managing care teams, integrating knowledge and resources to solve situational problems, fostering a team approach to service delivery, working collaboratively rather than individually, distributing knowledge, and working to improve operations and patient outcomes. This manuscript describes physician leadership and its goals, models of leadership, potential for cost reduction, information technology use, curricula, and organizational challenges in physician leadership programs. Additionally, the perceptions of physicians are examined following their participation in a six-month in-house leadership development program.

AB - Most academic health sciences centers offer faculty leadership development programs (LDPs); however, the outcomes of LDPs are largely unknown. This article describes perspectives from our 12-year experience cultivating a formal faculty LDP within an academic health center and longitudinal outcomes of our LDP. Responding to faculty concerns from University of California San Francisco’s (UCSF) 2001 Faculty Climate Survey, UCSF established the UCSF-Coro Faculty Leadership Collaborative (FLC) in 2005. The FLC focused on building leadership skills using a cohort-based, experiential, interactive and collaborative learning approach. From 2005 to 2012, FLC has conducted training for 136 graduates over 7 cohorts with 97.6% completion rate. FLC faculty participants included 64% women and 13% underrepresented minority (URM). The proportions of graduates attaining leadership positions within UCSF such as deans or department chairs among all, URM, and women URM graduates were 9.6%, 33.3% and 45.5%, respectively. A 2013 online survey assessed 2005–2012 graduates’ perceived impacts from 8 months to 8 years after program completion and showed 91.7% of survey respondents felt the program both increased their understanding of UCSF as an organization and demonstrated the University’s commitment to foster faculty development. Qualitative results indicated that graduates perceived benefits at individual, interpersonal, and organizational levels. Though we did not directly assess impact on faculty recruitment and retention, the findings to date support cohort-based experiential learning in faculty leadership training development.

AB - Three years ago, our residency program began a new approach to teaching practice management to our second- and third-year residents. The underlying principles for the new curriculum involved a realization that our residents lacked basic business understanding and that they would likely learn more effectively through a hands-on approach. The new curriculum, which we describe in this article, is in large part built around the establishment of a mock practice during the second year of residency. Although the curriculum is still evolving, initial response and evaluation have been encouraging.

AB - Women are persistently underrepresented in the higher levels of academic administration despite the fact that they have been entering the medical profession in increasing numbers for at least 20 years and now make up a large proportion of the medical student body and fill a similar proportion of entry level positions in medical schools. Although there are no easy remedies for gender inequalities in medical schools, strategies have been proposed and implemented both within academic institutions and more broadly to achieve and sustain the advancement opf women faculty to senior level positions. Substantial, sustained efforts to increase programs and activities addressing the major obstacles to advancement of women must be put in place so that the contributions of women can be fully realized and their skills fittingly applied in meeting the medical education and healthcare needs of all people in the 21st century.

AB - BACKGROUND: The role of residency program director is unique in medicine and medical education. Most program directors learn the job through trial and error, with a fortunate few benefiting from the wisdom and experience of their predecessors and mentors. In 1994, the Association of Family Practice Residency Directors (AFPRD) made the development of training and support resources for program directors a top priority. METHODS: With the support of the strategic plan of the AFPRD, the focus on excellence in residency education by the ABFP, and a survey documenting need, the National Institute for Program Director Development (NIPDD) was formed, with its sentinel product, a school for family practice residency directors. RESULTS: A fellowship-format 9-month training program was constructed using a multidimensional educational model. To date, there have been more than 300 participants. The curriculum emphasizes leadership development, resource allocation, a thorough familiarity with regulations and standards, educational options, and personnel management skills. A follow-up survey in 1999 documented an increase in program director tenure and an overall positive impact on family practice residency programs. CONCLUSIONS: Enhanced preparation for the job of residency program director results in a positive impact on both the director and the program.

AB - In this article, the authors discuss the problematic issue of transformational change in the face of cultural conflict between the worlds of clinical care and organizational leadership, and describe a case study of organizational cultural change facilitated through a physician leadership development program. A locally developed physician leadership program can be extremely effective at both improving physicians' leadership skills and increasing understanding of the strategic goals and direction of the organization. The transformational change required for physicians to develop and appreciate business and leadership skills can be supported and encouraged in a leadership development program that includes the components of careful curriculum design, program monitoring, and opportunities to apply new skills in practice. For Columbus Children's Hospital, Columbus, Ohio, this organizational transformational change effort was successfully achieved when a new medical leadership development program helped academic and community physicians to become involved in organizational leadership. The authors describe the background and development of this program and provide results of their evaluation of the program, with discussion of future extensions to the program.

AB - Background and Objectives: Practice management education is required in family medicine residencies, and requirements have recently been expanded. Surveys show that graduates feel unprepared to address practice management after graduation, so it is an aspect of training in need of improvement. Methods: We substituted a "simulated practice" for part of an established didactic program in practice management. The curriculum included 20 modules with specific practice management tasks to be completed by the residents. An objective examination covering a broad range of practice management topics was created and given twice to residents, once early in their second year and again at the end of third year. One group of residents participated in the simulated practice curriculum, and a comparison group participated in a standard didactic curriculum. Results: Our pre-test and post-test examinations each produced reliable data. Residents with simulated practice training had statistically significant increases in exam scores while the comparison group did not. The simulated practice group also increased scores on every subsection of the exam, while the comparison group increased scores on only half of the subsections. However, only one resident (in the intervention group) achieved >60% correct answers on the post-test examination. Conclusions: The increased learning demonstrated by improved test performance suggests that a simulated practice approach is more helpful than a standard didactic curriculum for teaching residents about practice management, but it still does not yield knowledge scores at an optimal level.

AB - In 2001, senior administrators in Emory University's Woodruff Health Sciences Center (WHSC) designated leadership as the central element of a new strategic plan, believing that an academic health center (AHC) requires excellence in leadership at all organizational levels to carry out the tripartite mission of teaching, research, and patient care. Leadership development in academic medicine presents unique challenges, however, including a wide range of professional roles and diverse operational centers that may be obstacles to unifying a leadership team in the pursuit of a central mission. Many administrators within academic medicine, although highly competent in their areas of expertise, possess limited leadership skills. In 2003, the WHSC created the Woodruff Leadership Academy (WLA) with the goal of developing a cadre of leaders throughout the WHSC with leadership skills relevant to an AHC and, specifically, to the WHSC. The graduates, called Woodruff Fellows, would work with senior leadership to create a shared vision of excellence and to pursue the goal of advancing all WHSC programs into the top rank of AHCs. After the first three years of the WLA, an informal assessment and a formal survey of the 70 fellows who had completed the program indicated that program graduates had embraced enhanced roles and responsibilities, undertaken new cross-disciplinary collaborative relationships, and acquired a renewed enthusiasm and respect for the shared vision of the WHSC. © 2007 Association of American Medical Colleges.

AB - Objective: To demonstrate that senior surgical residents would benefit from focused training by professionals with management expertise. Although managerial skills are recognized as necessary for the successful establishment of a surgical practice, they are not often emphasized in traditional surgical residency curricula. Design: Senior residents from all surgical subspecialties at McGill University were invited to participate in a 1-day management seminar. Precourse questionnaires aimed at evaluating the residents' perceptions of their own managerial knowledge and preparedness were circulated. The seminar was then given in the form of interactive lectures and case-based discussions. The questionnaires were readministered at the end of the course, along with an evaluation form. Precourse and postcourse data were compared using the Freeman-Halton extension of the Fisher exact test to determine statistical significance (P < .05). Setting: McGill University Health Centre in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Participants: A total of 43 senior residents. Results: Before the course, the majority of residents (27 of 43 [63%]) thought that management instruction only happened "from time to time" in their respective programs. After the course, 15 residents (35%) felt that management topics were "well addressed," and 19 (44%) felt that management topics have been "very well addressed" (P < .01). Residents noted a significant improvement in their ability to perform the following skills after the course: giving feedback, delegating duties, coping with stress, effective learning, and effective teaching. On the ensemble of all managerial skills combined, 26 residents (60%) rated their performance as "good" or "excellent" after the course vs only 21 (49%) before the course (P = .02). Residents also noted a statistically significant improvement in their ability to perform the managerial duties necessary for the establishment of a surgical practice. Conclusions: Surgical residency programs have the responsibility of preparing their residents for leadership and managerial roles in their future careers. An annual seminar serves as a starting point that could be built on for incorporating formal management training in surgical residency curricula. ©2012 American Medical Association.

AB - BACKGROUND: Health care organizations have suffered a steady decrease in operating margins in recent years while facing increased competition and pressure to provide ever-higher levels of customer service, quality of care, and innovation in delivery methodologies. The ability to rapidly find and implement changes that will lead to strategic improvement is critical. To assist member organizations in dealing with these issues, VHA Upper Midwest launched the Coaching and Leadership Initiative (VHA-CLI) in January 1999. The initiative was intended to develop new methods of collaborating for organizational learning of best practices, with a focus on generalizable change and deliberate leadership supports for deployment, diffusion, and sustainability. The emphasis was on the spread of ideas for improvement into all relevant corners of the organization. STRUCTURE AND PROCESS OF THE COLLABORATIVE: The structure of the VHA-CLI collaborative involved four waves of demonstration teams during 2 years. Each meeting of the collaborative included an executive session, team learning sessions (concepts applied to their improvement projects), and planning for the 6-month action period following the meeting. An important feature of the collaborative is the way in which teams in the various waves overlapped. For example, the Wave 1 team for a given organization came to a learning session in January 1999. At the second collaborative meeting in June 1999, the Wave 1 teams reported on the progress in their pilot sites. This meeting was also the kick-off session for the Wave 2 teams, which could learn about organizational culture and the improvement model from the efforts of their colleagues on Wave 1. Wave 1 teams also learned about and planned for spreading their efforts to other sites beyond the pilot. The pattern of multiple teams stretching across two waves of activity was repeated at every meeting of the collaborative. SUCCESS: Each organization in the collaborative has achieved improved outcomes around its selected clinical topics. In total, 26 teams have made significant improvement in 17 different topic areas. In addition, each organization has been able to successfully spread tested improvements to other individuals, teams, or locations, and the improvement work has become easier and more rapid with each successive cycle. CONCLUSIONS: The learning process initiated by this project will continue for at least another year in the VHA Upper Midwest region and will be expanded as participating organizations in other regions enroll in the VHA's national effort.

AB - Background: Paediatric residency programs rarely prepare trainees to assume resuscitation team leadership roles despite the recognized need for these skills by specialty accreditation organizations. We conducted a needs-assessment survey of all residents in the McGill Pediatric Residency Program, which demonstrated that most residents had minimal or no experience at leading resuscitation events and felt unprepared to assume this role in the future.Aims: We developed an educational intervention (workshop) and evaluated immediate and long term learning outcomes in order to determine whether residents could acquire and retain team leadership skills in pediatric advanced resuscitation. Methods: Fifteen paediatric residents participated in a workshop that we developed to fulfill the learning needs highlighted with the needs assessment, as well as the Objectives of Training in Pediatrics from the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada. It consisted of a plenary session followed by 2 simulated resuscitation scenarios. Team performance was evaluated by checklist. Residents were evaluated again 6 months later without prior interactive lecture. Learning was also assessed by self-reported retrospective pre/post questionnaire. Results: Checklist score (assigning roles, limitations of team, communication, overall team atmosphere) expressed as % correct: initial workshop scenario 1 vs. scenario 2 (63 vs. 82 p < 0.05); 6-month scenario with prior workshop exposure vs. control (74 vs. 50 p < 0.01); initial workshop scenario 2 vs. 6-month scenario control (82 vs. 50 p < 0.001). Retrospective pre/post survey (5 point Likert scale) revealed self-reported learning in knowledge of tasks, impact and components of communication, avoidance of fixation errors and overall leadership performance (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Residents acquired resuscitation team leadership skills following an educational intervention as shown by both observational checklist scores and self-reported survey. The six-month follow-up evaluation demonstrated skill retention beyond the initial intervention. A control group suggested that these results were due to completion of the first workshop.

AB - Background: Quality medical education includes both teaching and learning of data-driven knowledge, and appropriate technical skills and tacit behaviours, such as effective communication and professional leadership. But these implicit behaviours are not readily adaptable to traditional medical curriculum models. This manuscript explores a medical leadership curriculum informed by military education. Context: Our paediatric anaesthesia residents expressed a strong desire for more leadership opportunity within the training programme. Upon exploration, current health care models for leadership training were limited to short didactic presentations or lengthy certificate programmes. We could not find an appropriate model for our 1-year fellowship. Innovation: In collaboration with the US Naval Academy, we modified the 'Leadership Education and Development Program' curriculum to introduce daily and graduated leadership opportunities: starting with low-risk decision-making tasks and progressing to independent professional decision making and leadership. Each resident who opted into the programme had a 3-month role as team leader and spent 9 months as a team member. At the end of the first year of this curriculum both quantitative assessment and qualitative reflection from residents and faculty members noted significantly improved clinical and administrative decision making. The second-year residents' performance showed further improvement. Implications: Medical education has long emphasised subject-matter knowledge as a prime focus. However, in competency-based medical education, new curriculum models are needed. Many helpful models can be found in other professional fields. Collaborations between professional educators benefit the students, who are learning these new skills, the medical educators, who work jointly with other professionals, and the original curriculum designer, who has an opportunity to reflect on the strengths and weaknesses of his or her model. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2010.

AB - PURPOSE: The Hedwig van Ameringen Executive Leadership in Academic Medicine (ELAM) program provides an external yearlong development program for senior women faculty in U.S. and Canadian medical schools. This study aims to determine the extent to which program participants, compared with women from two comparison groups, aspire to leadership, demonstrate mastery of leadership competencies, and attain leadership positions. METHOD: A pre-/posttest methodology and longitudinal structure were used to evaluate the impact of ELAM participation. Participants from two ELAM cohorts were compared with women who applied but were not accepted into the ELAM program (NON) and women from the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) Faculty Roster. The AAMC group was a baseline for midcareer faculty; the NON group allowed comparison for leadership aspiration. Baseline data were collected in 2002, with follow-up data collected in 2006. Sixteen leadership indicators were considered: administrative leadership attainment (four indicators), full professor academic rank (one), leadership competencies and readiness (eight), and leadership aspirations and education (three). RESULTS: For 15 of the indicators, ELAM participants scored higher than AAMC and NON groups, and for one indicator they scored higher than only the AAMC group (aspiration to leadership outside academic health centers). The differences were statistically significant for 12 indicators and were distributed across the categories. These included seven of the leadership competencies, three of the administrative leadership attainment indicators, and two of the leadership aspirations and education indicators. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the hypothesis that the ELAM program has a beneficial impact on ELAM fellows in terms of leadership behaviors and career progression. © 2008 Association of American Medical Colleges.

AB - Background: Practice management education continues to evolve, and little information exists regarding its curriculum design and effectiveness for resident education. We report the results of an exploratory study of a practice management curriculum for primary care residents. Methods: After performing a needs assessment with a group of primary care residents at Wright State University, we designed a monthly seminar series covering twelve practice management topics. The curriculum consisted of interactive lectures and practice-based application, whenever possible. We descriptively evaluated two cognitive components (practice management knowledge and skills) and the residents' evaluation of the curriculum. Results: The mean correct on the knowledge test for this group of residents was 74% (n = 12) and 91% (n = 12) before and after the curriculum, respectively. The mean scores for the practice management skill assessments were 2.62 before (n = 12), and 3.65 after (n = 12) the curriculum (modified Likert, 1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree). The residents rated the curriculum consistently high. Conclusions: This exploratory study suggests that this curriculum may be useful in developing knowledge and skills in practice management for primary care residents. This study suggests further research into evaluation of this curriculum may be informative for practice-based education. © 2004 Crites and Schuster; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB - Objective: To test an intervention to enhance collaborative communication among nurse and physician leaders (eg, nurse manager, medical director, clinical nurse specialist) in two diverse intensive care units (lCUs). Background: Collaborative communication is associated with positive patient, nurse, and physician outcomes. However, to date, intervention-focused research that seeks to improve collaborative communication is lacking. Methods: A pretest-posttest repeated measures design incorporated baseline data collection, implementation of the intervention over 8 months, and immediate and 6-months-post data collection. Findings: Communication skills of ICU nurse and physician leaders improved significantly. Leaders also reported increased satisfaction with their own communication and leadership skills. In addition, staff nurse and physician perceptions of nursing leadership and problem solving between groups increased. Staff nurses reported lower personal stress (eg, more respect from co-workers, physicians, and managers), even though they perceived significantly more situational stress (eg, less staffing and time). Conclusion: Study findings provide evidence that nurse-physician collaborative communication can be improved.

AB - When prevocational medical trainees become registrars, they have increasing responsibilities for ensuring safe, effective, and timely delivery of health care, while simultaneously performing a number of managerial and leadership roles. Registrars do not currently receive training for their roles as front-line managers, despite this being an identified need by trainees and the health care workers with whom they interact. The national program for the Professional Development of Registrars is a soundly based, well developed and successful generic program that could be applied in a wide variety of postgraduate arenas.

AB - BACKGROUND: Clinical leadership is considered essential for maintaining and improving patient care and safety in the UK, and is incorporated in the curriculum for all trainee doctors., CONTEXT: Despite the growing focus on the importance of leadership, and the introduction of the Medical Leadership Competency Framework (MLCF) in the UK, leadership education for doctors in training is still in its infancy. Assessment is focused on clinical skills, and trainee doctors receive very little formal feedback on their leadership competencies., INNOVATION: In this article we describe the approach taken by Health Education Kent, Sussex and Surrey (HEKSS) to raise the profile of leadership amongst doctors in training in the South Thames Foundation School (STFS). An annual structured formative assessment in leadership for each trainee has been introduced, supported by leadership education for both trainees and their supervisors in HEKSS trusts. We analysed over 500 of these assessments from the academic year 2012/13 for foundation doctors in HEKSS trusts, in order to assess the quality of the feedback. From the analysis, potential indicators of more effective formative assessments were identified. These may be helpful in improving the leadership education programme for future years., IMPLICATIONS: There is a wealth of evidence to highlight the importance and value of formative assessments; however, particularly for foundation doctors, these have typically been focused on assessing clinical capabilities. This HEKSS initiative encourages doctors to recognise leadership opportunities at the beginning of their careers, seeks to help them understand the importance of acquiring leadership skills and provides structured feedback to help them improve. Leadership education for doctors in training is still in its infancy.Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB - Objective: To develop an educational intervention that targets residents' beliefs and attitudes to quality Improvement (QI) and leadership in order to demonstrate proactive behaviour., Design: Theory-driven, mixed methods study including document analysis, interviews, observations and open-ended questionnaires., Setting: Six Dutch teaching hospitals., Intervention: Using expertise from medicine, psychology, organizational and educational sciences we developed a situated learning programme named Ponder and IMProve (PIMP). The acronym PIMP reflects the original upbeat name in Dutch, Verwonder & Verbeter. It has a modern, positive meaning that relates to improving your current circumstances. In quarterly 1-h sessions residents are challenged to identify daily workplace frustrations and translate them into small-scale QI activities., Main outcome measures: Organizational awareness, beliefs and attitudes to QI and organizational responsibilities, resident behaviour, barriers and facilitators to successful learning and the programme's potential impact on the organization., Results: Overall, 19 PIMP meetings were held over a period of 3 years. Residents defined 119 PIMP goals, resolved 37 projects and are currently working on another 39 projects. Interviews show that PIMP sessions make residents more aware of the organizational aspects of their daily work. Moreover, residents feel empowered to take up the role of change agent. Facilitators for success include a positive cost-benefit trade-off, a valuable group process and a safe learning environment., Conclusion: This article demonstrates the added value of multidisciplinary theory-driven research for the design, development and evaluation of educational programmes. Residents can be encouraged to develop organizational awareness and reshape their daily frustrations in QI work.Copyright © The Author 2016.

AB - Being a well-rounded physician requires competencies that extend beyond traditional medical training. This study explores one residency program's attempt to address the need to foster career management and leadership skills. A year-long didactic program was initiated to tackle both career management and leadership development. At the conclusion of the program, a survey revealed an increase in perceived competency in the domains taught. There was also a measurable increase in the amount of scholarly and quality improvement projects done in the department where the program was implemented. To support and develop physician competencies, healthcare organizations may derive immense benefit from a program that fosters both career management and leadership skills.

AB - Introduction Medical engagement in healthcare organisations can improve service development and patient experience. Doctors in training have limited opportunities to engage in service improvement work and develop leadership skills. Method We describe the Specialist Trainees Engaged in Leadership Programme (STEP), a programme developed to introduce concepts of medical leadership and quality improvement skills in the Belfast Trust. STEP started in 2013 and over 140 trainees have now participated in the programme. Results Over 42 quality improvement projects have been completed with the support of the programme. Evaluation of STEP has demonstrated an improvement across all domains explored throughout the duration of the programme, with benefits for the individual trainee and the wider organisation. Discussion We describe the programme in detail. The STEP curriculum can easily be adapted to meet the needs of NHS trainees, allowing them to understand the objectives and strategy of their employers and improve their ability to plan and deliver safe, effective, patient-centred care.

AB - Introduction: In today’s team-oriented healthcare environment, high-quality patient care requires physicians to possess not only medical knowledge and technical skills but also crisis resource management (CRM) skills. In emergency medicine (EM), the high acuity and dynamic environment makes CRM skills of physicians particularly critical to healthcare team success. The Accreditation Council of Graduate Medicine Education Core Competencies that guide residency program curriculums include CRM skills; however, EM residency programs are not given specific instructions as to how to teach these skills to their trainees. This article describes a simulation-based CRM course designed specifically for novice EM residents. Methods: The CRM course includes an introductory didactic presentation followed by a series of simulation scenarios and structured debriefs. The course is designed to use observational learning within simulation education to decrease the time and resources required for implementation. To assess the effectiveness in improving team CRM skills, two independent raters use a validated CRM global rating scale to measure the CRM skills displayed by teams of EM interns in a pretest and posttest during the course. Results: The CRM course improved leadership, problem solving, communication, situational awareness, teamwork, resource utilization and overall CRM skills displayed by teams of EM interns. While the improvement from pretest to posttest did not reach statistical significance for this pilot study, the large effect sizes suggest that statistical significance may be achieved with a larger sample size. Conclusion: This course can feasibly be incorporated into existing EM residency curriculums to provide EM trainees with basic CRM skills required of successful emergency physicians. We believe integrating CRM training early into existing EM education encourages continued deliberate practice, discussion, and improvement of essential CRM skills.

AB - Purpose: The aim of this study was to measure the effectiveness of introducing a full five-day practice management (PM) training workshop based on selected Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) competencies; professionalism, interpersonal and communication skills, practice-based learning and improvement (PBLI), and system-based practice. Methods: The study used pre-post study design. A total of 39 family medicine residents in Qatar were included in this study. The outcomes of interest were the level of change in the selected ACGME competencies. Pre- vs. post-workshop scores as well as change in scores of quarterly formative assessment were analysed using paired T-test. Results: The overall improvement in post-programme scores compared to pre-programme scores was 9.8% (p-value < 0.001). The PGY1 Group showed the most significant improvement with a score difference of 18.6% (p-value < 0.001). In self-assessment of skills, the main improvement was in writing objectives and time management skills (p-value < 0.001). The residents showed greater improvements in scores related to communication skills specifically in communicating effectively with patients (p-value = 0.032) as well as in specified skills among system-based practices; specifically in effectively using health resources (p-value < 0.001) and in co-ordinating patient care (p-value < 0.001). Conclusion: Implementing a full five-days PM training workshop had resulted in moderate improvements in residents' score in selected ACGME competencies. A longer study on whether the effects of the programme on residents' sustained performance and applicability in practice is required.

AB - BACKGROUND: Physicians are required to assume a leadership role as part of their career. For most, this is not an innate characteristic and must be developed throughout their medical training. There are few residency courses designed to assist in the enhancement of these leadership skills. We created and implemented a novel course on leadership, utilizing weekly presentations designed to stimulate discussions and improve the leadership qualities of trainees., METHODS: Senior residents provided leadership lectures stimulated by assigned readings from the book "The Founding Fathers on Leadership." The traits and characteristics demonstrated throughout course readings and discussions were subsequently incorporated into everyday resident activities. Baseline and post-course survey responses were evaluated to assess changes in leadership qualities., RESULTS: Seven senior (postgraduate year (PGY) 3-5) participated as course leaders. All seven filled out pre- and post-course surveys. Seventeen junior residents (PGY 1-2) were involved as audience members. Significant pre- and post-course differences were noted in the following areas: feelings of increased encouragement of personal development (4.86 vs. 5.43, p=0.03); increased team participation in decision-making (4.00 vs. 4.57, p=0.03); increased ease of obtaining answers to difficult questions (4.57 vs. 5.23, p=0.047); increased team member work (4.86 vs. 5.71, p=0.047), and a sense of leading a more balanced life (3.86 vs. 4.43, p=0.03)., CONCLUSION: The initiation of a novel leadership course for senior surgical residents led to an enjoyable experience, resulting in enhanced leadership skills for all participants. We believe this process resulted in a more cohesive, efficient, communicative, and supportive residency program.

AB - Introduction: The potential for "discontinuities in care" arising from the turbulent transition from specialist trainee to consultant specialist presents risks to patient safety. But it is easy to lose sight of the affective needs of individuals facing the burden of keeping patients safe. This article describes a 2-day program focused on new and prospective consultant specialist ophthalmic surgeons entitled "Sailing a Safe Ship" (SASS). The purpose was to facilitate understanding and analysis of their personal holistic learning needs and enhance individual agency in optimizing learning during the transition period. Methods: The program used gaming, team challenges, meta-planning, role play and professional actors, interactive presentations, and self-analysis tools to portray the real world of consultant specialist practice in terms of ill-defined problems requiring "elite communication" and effective negotiation of value differences and priorities for their resolution. Participants' insights into their individual learning were recorded in scheduled reflective sessions. The immediate impact on their learning was also considered in terms of direct (instructional) and indirect (nurturant) effects. Results: Participants' insights reflected 4 key themes: admitting vulnerability and uncertainty, taking responsibility for managing risk, being self-aware and reflexive, and internalizing authentic leadership. Four instructional and 4 nurturant effects were revealed. Preliminary findings on long-term impact on participants' practice are outlined. Discussion: Evidence from the evaluation indicated that participants felt empowered to construct a personal strategic response to unfamiliar and unanticipated workplace demands and pressures, adopt a capability mindset that would accelerate their capacity to fulfill an enhanced leadership role, and take a holistic approach to their continuing self-directed development as leaders and educators. © 2013 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education, and the Council on CME, Association for Hospital Medical Education.

AB - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to describe a successful and exportable training module that addresses Next Accreditation System (NAS) behavioral milestones for leadership competencies., METHODS: A novel leadership training module, which required the creation of original business plans by teams of residents, was incorporated into a psychiatry PGY-2 training curriculum., RESULTS: In the creation and presentation of their business plans, the residents demonstrated competencies in the NAS functional domains of interpersonal and communication skills, professionalism, practice-based learning and improvement, and systems-based practice. Residents who responded with feedback after completing the course were very positive about their experience., CONCLUSIONS: The leadership training module described here allowed residents to acquire and demonstrate many of the competencies specified in leadership-oriented NAS milestones. The module did not require additional funding or a formal rotation or "track," is scalable to accommodate any number of residents and can be modified based on available local teaching resources.

AB - Problem The scope and scale of developments in health care redesign have not been sufficiently adopted in primary care residency programs. Approach The interdisciplinary Primary Care Faculty Development Initiative was created to teach faculty how to accelerate revisions in primary care residency training. The program focused on skill development in teamwork, change management, leadership, population management, clinical microsystems, and competency assessment. The 2013 pilot program involved 36 family medicine, internal medicine, and pediatric faculty members from 12 residencies in four locations. Outcomes The percentage of participants rating intention to implement what was learned as "very likely to" or "absolutely will" was 16/32 (50%) for leadership, 24/33 (72.7%) for change management, 23/33 (69.7%) for systems thinking, 25/32 (75.8%) for population management, 28/33 (84.9%) for teamwork, 29/33 (87.8%) for competency assessment, and 30/31 (96.7%) for patient centeredness. Content analysis revealed five key themes: leadership skills are key drivers of change, but program faculty face big challenges in changing culture and engaging stakeholders; access to data from electronic health records for population management is a universal challenge; readiness to change varies among the three disciplines and among residencies within each discipline; focusing on patients and their needs galvanizes collaborative efforts across disciplines and within residencies; and collaboration among disciplines to develop and use shared measures of residency programs and learner outcomes can guide and inspire program changes and urgently needed educational research. Next Steps Revise and reevaluate this rapidly evolving program toward widespread engagement with family medicine, internal medicine, and pediatric residencies.

AB - BACKGROUND: Limited data exist on how to develop resident leadership and communication skills during actual trauma resuscitations., METHODS: An evaluation tool was developed to grade senior resident performance as the team leader during full-trauma-team activations. Thirty actions that demonstrated the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education core competencies were graded on a Likert scale of 1 (poor) to 5 (exceptional). These actions were grouped by their respective core competencies on 5 x 7-inch index cards. In Phase 1, baseline performance scores were obtained. In Phase 2, trauma-focused communication in-services were conducted early in the academic year, and immediate, personalized feedback sessions were performed after resuscitations based on the evaluation tool. In Phase 3, residents received only evaluation-based feedback following resuscitations., RESULTS: In Phase 1 (October 2009 to April 2010), 27 evaluations were performed on 10 residents. In Phase 2 (April 2010 to October 2010), 28 evaluations were performed on nine residents. In Phase 3 (October 2010 to January 2012), 44 evaluations were performed on 13 residents. Total scores improved significantly between Phases 1 and 2 (p = 0.003) and remained elevated throughout Phase 3. When analyzing performance by competency, significant improvement between Phases 1 and 2 (p < 0.05) was seen in all competencies (patient care, knowledge, system-based practice, practice-based learning) with the exception of "communication and professionalism" (p = 0.56). Statistically similar scores were observed between Phases 2 and 3 in all competencies with the exception of "medical knowledge," which showed ongoing significant improvement (p = 0.003)., CONCLUSIONS: Directed resident feedback sessions utilizing data from a real-time, competency-based evaluation tool have allowed us to improve our residents' abilities to lead trauma resuscitations over a 30-month period. Given pressures to maximize clinical educational opportunities among work-hour constraints, such a model may help decrease the need for costly simulation-based training., LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic study, level III.

AB - BACKGROUND: Anesthesiology residency primarily emphasizes the development of medical knowledge and technical skills. Yet, nontechnical skills (NTS) are also vital to successful clinical practice. Elements of NTS are communication, teamwork, situational awareness, and decision making. METHODS: The first 10 consecutive senior residents who chose to participate in this 2-week elective rotation of operating room (OR) management and leadership training were enrolled in this study, which spanned from March 2013 to March 2015. Each resident served as the anesthesiology officer of the day (AOD) and was tasked with coordinating OR assignments, managing care for 2 to 4 ORs, and being on call for the trauma OR; all residents were supervised by an attending AOD. Leadership and NTS techniques were taught via a standardized curriculum consisting of leadership and team training articles, crisis management text, and daily debriefings. Resident self-ratings and attending AOD and charge nurse raters used the Anaesthetists' Non-Technical Skills (ANTS) scoring system, which involved task management, situational awareness, teamwork, and decision making. For each of the 10 residents in their third year of clinical anesthesiology training (CA-3) who participated in this elective rotation, there were 14 items that required feedback from resident self-assessment and OR raters, including the daily attending AOD and charge nurse. Results for each of the items on the questionnaire were compared between the beginning and the end of the rotation with the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for matched samples. Comparisons were run separately for attending AOD and charge nurse assessments and resident self-assessments. Scaled rankings were analyzed for the Kendall coefficient of concordance (ω) for rater agreement with associated χ2 and P value. RESULTS: Common themes identified by the residents during debriefings were recurrence of challenging situations and the skills residents needed to instruct and manage clinical teams. For attending AOD and charge nurse assessments, resident performance of NTS improved from the beginning to the end of the rotation on 12 of the 14 NTS items (P <.05), whereas resident self-assessment improved on 3 NTS items (P <.05). Interrater reliability (across the charge nurse, resident, and AOD raters) ranged from ω =.36 to.61 at the beginning of the rotation and ω =.27 to.70 at the end of the rotation. CONCLUSIONS: This rotation allowed for teaching and resident assessment to occur in a way that facilitated resident education in several of the skills required to meet specific milestones. Resident physicians are able to foster NTS and build a framework for clinical leadership when completing a 2-week senior elective as an OR manager.

AB - Purpose - With the extent of change in healthcare today, organizations need strong physician leaders. To compensate for the lack of physician leadership education, many organizations are sending physicians to external leadership programs or developing in-house leadership programs targeted specifically to physicians. The purpose of this paper is to outline the evaluation strategy and outcomes of the inaugural year of a Physician Leadership Academy (PLA) developed and implemented at a Michigan-based regional healthcare system. Design/methodology/approach - The authors applied the theoretical framework of Kirkpatrick's four levels of evaluation and used surveys, observations, activity tracking, and interviews to evaluate the program outcomes. The authors applied grounded theory techniques to the interview data. Findings - The program met targeted outcomes across all four levels of evaluation. Interview themes focused on the significance of increasing self-awareness, building relationships, applying new skills, and building confidence. Research limitations/implications - While only one example, this study illustrates the importance of developing the evaluation strategy as part of the program design. Qualitative research methods, often lacking from learning evaluation design, uncover rich themes of impact. The study supports how a PLA program can enhance physician learning, engagement, and relationship building throughout and after the program. Physician leaders' partnership with organization development and learning professionals yield results with impact to individuals, groups, and the organization. Originality/value - Few studies provide an in-depth review of evaluation methods and outcomes of physician leadership development programs. Healthcare organizations seeking to develop similar in-house programs may benefit applying the evaluation strategy outlined in this study.

AB - Introduction Surgical Training and Education in Promoting Professionalism (STEPP) was developed in 2011 to train tomorrow's leaders during residency. It is based on virtue ethics and takes an approach similar to West Point military academy. The purpose of this research was: (i) to compare the virtue profiles of our residents with that of the military cohort using a standardized virtue assessment tool; and (ii) to assess the value of virtue education on residents. Methods As part of STEPP, otolaryngology residents participated in a virtue-based validated assessment tool called Virtue in Action (VIA) Inventory. This was completed at the initiation of STEPP in July 2011 as well as 1 year later in June 2012. Comparison of the VIA to a military cohort was performed. Leadership 'Basic Training' is a series of forums focused on virtues of initiative, integrity, responsibility, self-discipline, and accountability. A pre- and post-test was administered assessing resident perceptions of the value of this 'Basic Training'. Results Virtues are shared between otolaryngology residents (n=9) and military personnel (n=2,433) as there were no significant differences in strength scores between two military comparison groups and otolaryngology-head and neck surgery (OHNS) residents. There was a significant improvement (p<0.001) in the understanding of components of the leadership vision and a significant improvement in the understanding of key leadership concepts based on 'Basic Training'. All residents responded in the post-test that the STEPP program was valuable, up from 56%. Conclusions A virtue-based approach is valued by residents as a part of leadership training during residency.

AB - OBJECTIVE: Creating training opportunities for the development of effective leaders is an increasingly important goal in psychiatry residency training programs. This article examines the long-term perceived impact of the Tarrytown Chief Residents Leadership Conference on preparing psychiatric residents for future leadership positions. METHODS: Self-report surveys from attendees who participated in the conference between 1998 and 2011 were examined. RESULTS: Five hundred and forty-one completed surveys were returned (43 % response rate). Eighty-six percent of respondents reported moderate to extreme improvement in leadership confidence post-conference. Most respondents indicated at least moderate improvement in self-awareness (93 %), understanding of group process (92 %), and willingness to address conflict (89 %). Ninety percent felt the conference was important to their residency training, and 80 % indicated increased interest in leadership post-conference. CONCLUSIONS: Responders reported lasting improvements in their confidence in and perceived ability to utilize skills necessary for effective leadership, demonstrating the value of this experiential learning opportunity.

AB - The Workshop for New Leaders represents an innovative project undertaken by the midwifery faculty at a teaching hospital in New England. The midwifery faculty sought to expand their educational offerings to the obstetrics and gynecology residents. Utilizing creative thinking strategies, the idea for a leadership workshop was originated in an effort to augment the professionalism curriculum mandated by the Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education for residents. Over time, this workshop has become a highlight for each class. Not only has this workshop facilitated transition from learner to leader as the residents approach their final year of training, it has also helped to enhance interprofessional relationships.

AB - PROBLEM: Many health care organizations seek physicians to lead quality improvement (QI) efforts, yet struggle to find individuals with the necessary expertise. Although most residency programs incorporate QI and patient safety principles into their curricula, few provide a specialized training program for residents exploring careers as physician leaders in quality. APPROACH: Recognizing this training void, the authors designed and implemented the Healthcare Leadership in Quality (HLQ) track for residents at the University of Pennsylvania Health System in 2010. This longitudinal, two-year graduate medical education (GME) track aligns with the quality goals of the University of Pennsylvania Health System and includes a core curriculum, integration into an interprofessional health care leadership team that is accountable for quality and safety outcomes on a hospital unit, a capstone QI project, and mentorship. OUTCOMES: Early evaluation has demonstrated the feasibility and efficacy of the track diverse graduate medical education training programs. Using Yardley and Dornan's interpretation of the Kirkpatrick framework, the authors have demonstrated the track's impact on four levels of educational and organizational outcomes. NEXT STEPS: Building on their early experiences, the authors are integrating project and time management skills into the core curriculum, and they are focusing more effort on faculty development in QI mentorship. Additionally, the authors plan to follow HLQ track graduates to determine whether they seek leadership roles in quality and safety and to assess the influence of the program on their careers.

AB - BACKGROUND: For the purpose of providing excellent patient care, residents need to be strong, effective leaders. The lack of clinical leadership is alarming given the detrimental effects on patient safety. The objective of the study was to assess whether a leadership training addressing transactional and transformational leadership enhances leadership skills in residents., METHODS: A volunteer sample of 57 residents from postgraduate year one to four was recruited across a range of medical specialties. The residents took part in an interventional controlled trial. The four-week IMPACT leadership training provided specific strategies for leadership in the clinical environment, addressing transactional (e.g. active control, contingent reward) and transformational leadership skills (e.g. appreciation, inspirational motivation). Transactional and transformational leadership skill performance was rated (1) on the Performance Scale by an external evaluator blinded to the study design and (2) self-assessed transformational and transactional leadership skills. Both measures contained items of the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire, with higher scores indicating greater leadership skills., RESULTS: Both scores were significantly different between the IMPACT group and the control group. In the IMPACT group, the Performance Scale increased 15% in transactional leadership skill performance (2.10 to 2.86) (intervention effect, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.40 to 1.13; p < .001, eta2 = 0.31) and 14% in transformational leadership skill performance (2.26 to 2.94) (intervention effect, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.27 to 1.09; p < .001, eta2 = 0.22). The self-assessed transactional skills revealed a 4% increase (3.83 to 4.03) (intervention effect, 0.20; 95% CI, 0.08 to 0.33; p < .001, eta2 = 0.18) and a 6% increase in transformational leadership skills (3.54 to 3.86) (intervention effect, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.02 to 0.40; p< .001, eta2 = 0.53)., DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the use of the transactional and transformational leadership framework for graduate leadership training. Future studies should incorporate time-latent post-tests, evaluating the stability of the behavioral performance increase.

AB - BACKGROUND: In a dynamic health care system, strong leadership has never been more important for surgeons. Little is known about how to design and conduct effectively a leadership program specifically for surgeons. We sought to evaluate critically a Leadership Development Program for practicing surgeons by exploring how the program's strengths and weaknesses affected the surgeons' development as physician-leaders., METHODS: At a large academic institution, we conducted semistructured interviews with 21 surgical faculty members who applied voluntarily, were selected, and completed a newly created Leadership Development Program in December 2012. Interview transcripts underwent qualitative descriptive analysis with thematic coding based on grounded theory. Themes were extracted regarding surgeons' evaluations of the program on their development as physician-leaders., RESULTS: After completing the program, surgeons reported personal improvements in the following 4 areas: self-empowerment to lead, self-awareness, team-building skills, and knowledge in business and leadership. Surgeons felt "more confident about stepping up as a leader" and more aware of "how others view me and my interactions." They described a stronger grasp on "giving feedback" as well as a better understanding of "business/organizational issues." Overall, surgeon-participants reported positive impacts of the program on their day-to-day work activities and general career perspective as well as on their long-term career development plans. Surgeons also recommended areas where the program could potentially be improved., CONCLUSION: These interviews detailed self-reported improvements in leadership knowledge and capabilities for practicing surgeons who completed a Leadership Development Program. A curriculum designed specifically for surgeons may enable future programs to equip surgeons better for important leadership roles in a complex health care environment.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB - Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to determine the impact of an integrated Medical Leadership Programme (MLP) on a cohort of participating specialty doctors and the NHS services with which they were engaged. Design/methodology/approach – This was a qualitative study designed to obtain rich textual data on a novel training intervention. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with participating MLP trainees at fixed points throughout the programme in order to capture their experiences. Resulting data were triangulated with data from extant documentation, including trainees’ progress reports and summaries of achievements. Recurring discourses and themes were identified using a framework thematic analysis. Findings – Evidence of the positive impact upon trainees and NHS services was identified, along with challenges. Evidence of impact across all the domains within the national Medical Leadership Competency Framework was also identified, including demonstrating personal qualities, working with others, managing services, improving services and setting direction. Research limitations/implications – Data were drawn from interviews with a small population of trainees undertaking a pilot MLP in a single deanery, so there are inevitable limitations for generalisability in the quantitative sense. Whilst the pilot trainees were a self-selected group, it was a group of mixed origin and ability. Practical implications – The study has provided valuable lessons for the design of future leadership programmes aimed at doctors in training. Originality/value – Identifying the effectiveness of an innovative model of delivery with regard to the Medical Leadership Curriculum may assist with medical staff engagement and support health service improvements to benefit patient care.
